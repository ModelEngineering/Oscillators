It is based on measuring changes in steady-state metabolite concentrations and fluxes induced by parameter modulations. It has the important advantage that it is not necessary to know the values of the changes in the parameters. Here we develop a matrix formulation of the double-modulation method that allows it to be applied to metabolic systems of any structure and size. It also shows which parameters need to be modulated and which variables need to be measured in order to calculate the elasticities that correspond to particular rates. Some suggestions for the practical implementation of the method are given, including various ways of testing the reliability of the results.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: Intrinsic fluctuations due to the stochastic nature of biochemical reactions can have large effects on the response of biochemical networks. This is particularly true for pathways that involve transcriptional regulation, where generally there are two copies of each gene and the number of messenger RNA (mRNA) molecules can be small. Therefore, there is a need for computational tools for developing and investigating stochastic models of biochemical networks. RESULTS: We have developed the software package Biochemical Network Stochastic Simulator (BioNetS) for efficiently and accurately simulating stochastic models of biochemical networks. BioNetS has a graphical user interface that allows models to be entered in a straightforward manner, and allows the user to specify the type of random variable (discrete or continuous) for each chemical species in the network. The discrete variables are simulated using an efficient implementation of the Gillespie algorithm. For the continuous random variables, BioNetS constructs and numerically solves the appropriate chemical Langevin equations. The software package has been developed to scale efficiently with network size, thereby allowing large systems to be studied. BioNetS runs as a BioSpice agent and can be downloaded from http://www.biospice.org. BioNetS also can be run as a stand alone package. All the required files are accessible from http://x.amath.unc.edu/BioNetS. CONCLUSIONS: We have developed BioNetS to be a reliable tool for studying the stochastic dynamics of large biochemical networks. Important features of BioNetS are its ability to handle hybrid models that consist of both continuous and discrete random variables and its ability to model cell growth and division. We have verified the accuracy and efficiency of the numerical methods by considering several test systems.},

The data are expressed as molar ratios of metabolite concentration to enzyme site concentration. Of the 140 ratios calculated, 88\% were one or greater, indicating that in general substrates exceed their cognate enzyme concentrations. Of the 17 cases where enzyme exceeds metabolite concentration, 16 were in glycolysis. The data in general justify the use of enzyme kinetic mechanisms determined in vitro in the construction of dynamic models which simulate in vivo metabolism.},

  Abstract                 = {A cell's behavior is a consequence of the complex interactions between its numerous constituents, such as DNA, RNA, proteins and small molecules. Cells use signaling pathways and regulatory mechanisms to coordinate multiple processes, allowing them to respond to and adapt to an ever-changing environment. The large number of components, the degree of interconnectivity and the complex control of cellular networks are becoming evident in the integrated genomic and proteomic analyses that are emerging. It is increasingly recognized that the understanding of properties that arise from whole-cell function require integrated, theoretical descriptions of the relationships between different cellular components. Recent theoretical advances allow us to describe cellular network structure with graph concepts and have revealed organizational features shared with numerous non-biological networks. We now have the opportunity to describe quantitatively a network of hundreds or thousands of interacting components. Moreover, the observed topologies of cellular networks give us clues about their evolution and how their organization influences their function and dynamic responses.},

  Abstract                 = {The most efficient way to store thermodynamic data on enzyme-catalyzed reactions is to use matrices of species properties. Since equilibrium in enzyme-catalyzed reactions is reached at specified pH values, the thermodynamics of the reactions is discussed in terms of transformed thermodynamic properties. These transformed thermodynamic properties are complicated functions of temperature, pH, and ionic strength that can be calculated from the matrices of species values. The most important of these transformed thermodynamic properties is the standard transformed Gibbs energy of formation of a reactant (sum of species). It is the most important because when this function of temperature, pH, and ionic strength is known, all the other standard transformed properties can be calculated by taking partial derivatives. The species database in this package contains data matrices for 199 reactants. For 94 of these reactants, standard enthalpies of formation of species are known, and so standard transformed Gibbs energies, standard transformed enthalpies, standard transformed entropies, and average numbers of hydrogen atoms can be calculated as functions of temperature, pH, and ionic strength. For reactions between these 94 reactants, the changes in these properties can be calculated over a range of temperatures, pHs, and ionic strengths, and so can apparent equilibrium constants. For the other 105 reactants, only standard transformed Gibbs energies of formation and average numbers of hydrogen atoms at 298.15 K can be calculated. The loading of this package provides functions of pH and ionic strength at 298.15 K for standard transformed Gibbs energies of formation and average numbers of hydrogen atoms for 199 reactants. It also provides functions of temperature, pH, and ionic strength for the standard transformed Gibbs energies of formation, standard transformed enthalpies of formation, standard transformed entropies of formation, and average numbers of hydrogen atoms for 94 reactants. Thus loading this package makes available 774 mathematical functions for these properties. These functions can be added and subtracted to obtain changes in these properties in biochemical reactions and apparent equilibrium constants.},

Here I review network motifs and their functions, with an emphasis on experimental studies. Network motifs in other biological networks are also mentioned, including signalling and neuronal networks.},

  Abstract                 = {Cells respond to the environment by regulating the expression of genes according to environmental signals. The relation between the input signal level and the expression of the gene is called the gene regulation function. It is of interest to understand the shape of a gene regulation function in terms of the environment in which it has evolved and the basic constraints of biological systems. Here we address this by presenting a cost-benefit theory for gene regulation functions that takes into account temporally varying inputs in the environment and stochastic noise in the biological components. We apply this theory to the well-studied lac operon of E. coli. The present theory explains the shape of this regulation function in terms of temporal variation of the input signals, and of minimizing the deleterious effect of cell-cell variability in regulatory protein levels. We also apply the theory to understand the evolutionary tradeoffs in setting the number of regulatory proteins and for selection of feed-forward loops in genetic circuits. The present cost-benefit theory can be used to understand the shape of other gene regulatory functions in terms of environment and noise constraints.},

We compare 12 software packages with respect to their functionality, reliability, efficiency, user-friendliness and compatibility. Although most programs performed reliably in all numerical tasks tested, SBML compatibility and the set-up of multicompartmentalization are problematic in many packages. For simple models, GEPASI seems the best choice for non-expert users. For large-scale models, environments such as Jarnac/JDesigner are preferable, because they allow modular implementation of models. Virtual Cell is the most versatile program and provides the simplest and clearest functionality for setting up multicompartmentalization.},

  Abstract                 = {SmartCell has been developed to be a general framework for modelling and simulation of diffusion-reaction networks in a whole-cell context. It supports localisation and diffusion by using a mesoscopic stochastic reaction model. The SmartCell package can handle any cell geometry, considers different cell compartments, allows localisation of species, supports DNA transcription and translation, membrane diffusion and multistep reactions, as well as cell growth. Moreover, different temporal and spatial constraints can be applied to the model. A GUI interface that facilitates model making is also available. In this work we discuss limitations and advantages arising from the approach used in SmartCell and determine the impact of localisation on the behaviour of simple well-defined networks, previously analysed with differential equations. Our results show that this factor might play an important role in the response of networks and cannot be neglected in cell simulations.},

  Abstract                 = {Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) is a powerful and widely applied technique for detecting the association of individual proteins with specific genomic regions in vivo. Live cells are treated with formaldehyde to generate protein-protein and protein- DNA cross-links between molecules in close proximity on the chromatin template in vivo. DNA sequences that cross-link with a given protein are selectively enriched and reversal of the formaldehyde cross-link permits recovery and quantitative analysis of the immunoprecipitated DNA. As formaldehyde inactivates cellular enzymes essentially immediately upon addition to cells, ChIP provides snapshots of protein-protein and protein- DNA interactions at a particular time point, and hence is useful for kinetic analysis of events occurring on chromosomal sequences in vivo. In addition, ChIP can be combined with microarray technology to identify the location of specific proteins on a genome-wide basis. This unit describes the ChIP protocol for Saccharomyces cerevisiae; however, it is also applicable to other organisms.},

  Abstract                 = {It is quite important to estimate the metabolic flux distribution (MFD) vectors in vivo, and to investigate the effect of culture environments on the flux distributions to uncover the metabolic regulation mechanism of microbial cells. The conventional approach is to compute the MFD using the stoichiometric equations and the measured specific rates (input and output variables). However, this method cannot give the MFD for the complex metabolic network which includes cyclic pathways. In the present investigation, we considered the method of analysing the metabolic fluxes based on 13C tracer experiments. In particular, we compared the different techniques of estimating the bidirectional fluxes in the metabolic networks, studying their applicability with respect to the different types of data formats obtained through GC-MS (gas chromatography-mass spectrometry) and NMR (nuclear magnetic resonance) measurements in labeling experiments. It was found that some techniques cannot be applied for GC-MS and NMR data. In the present research, therefore, a new preprocessing method for MS and NMR data was developed, to solve some of the problems encountered in the conventional approaches.},

  Abstract                 = {Malaria is a global health problem that threatens 300-500 million people and kills more than one million people annually. Disease control is hampered by the occurrence of multi-drug-resistant strains of the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum. Synthetic antimalarial drugs and malarial vaccines are currently being developed, but their efficacy against malaria awaits rigorous clinical testing. Artemisinin, a sesquiterpene lactone endoperoxide extracted from Artemisia annua L (family Asteraceae; commonly known as sweet wormwood), is highly effective against multi-drug-resistant Plasmodium spp., but is in short supply and unaffordable to most malaria sufferers. Although total synthesis of artemisinin is difficult and costly, the semi-synthesis of artemisinin or any derivative from microbially sourced artemisinic acid, its immediate precursor, could be a cost-effective, environmentally friendly, high-quality and reliable source of artemisinin. Here we report the engineering of Saccharomyces cerevisiae to produce high titres (up to 100 mg l(-1)) of artemisinic acid using an engineered mevalonate pathway, amorphadiene synthase, and a novel cytochrome P450 monooxygenase (CYP71AV1) from A. annua that performs a three-step oxidation of amorpha-4,11-diene to artemisinic acid. The synthesized artemisinic acid is transported out and retained on the outside of the engineered yeast, meaning that a simple and inexpensive purification process can be used to obtain the desired product. Although the engineered yeast is already capable of producing artemisinic acid at a significantly higher specific productivity than A. annua, yield optimization and industrial scale-up will be required to raise artemisinic acid production to a level high enough to reduce artemisinin combination therapies to significantly below their current prices.},

Components of the Lac and Ntr systems were used to construct genetic circuits that display toggle switch or oscillatory behavior. Both devices contain an "activator module" consisting of a modified glnA promoter with lac operators, driving the expression of the activator, NRI. Since NRI activates the glnA promoter, this creates an autoactivated circuit repressible by LacI. The oscillator contains a "repressor module" consisting of the NRI-activated glnK promoter driving LacI expression. This circuitry produced synchronous damped oscillations in turbidostat cultures, with periods much longer than the cell cycle. For the toggle switch, LacI was provided constitutively; the level of active repressor was controlled by using a lacY mutant and varying the concentration of IPTG. This circuitry provided nearly discontinuous expression of activator.},

  Abstract                 = {Recent work demonstrates that stochastic fluctuations in molecular populations have consequences for gene regulation. Previous experiments focused on noise sources or noise propagation through gene networks by measuring noise magnitudes. However, in theoretical analysis, we showed that noise frequency content is determined by the underlying gene circuits, leading to a mapping between gene circuit structure and the noise frequency range. An intriguing prediction from our previous studies was that negative autoregulation shifts noise to higher frequencies where it is more easily filtered out by gene networks--a property that may contribute to the prevalence of autoregulation motifs (for example, found in the regulation of approximately 40\% of Escherichia coli genes). Here we measure noise frequency content in growing cultures of E. coli, and verify the link between gene circuit structure and noise spectra by demonstrating the negative autoregulation-mediated spectral shift. We further demonstrate that noise spectral measurements provide mechanistic insights into gene regulation, as perturbations of gene circuit parameters are discernible in the measured noise frequency ranges. These results suggest that noise spectral measurements could facilitate the discovery of novel regulatory relationships.},

  Abstract                 = {In trypanosomes the first part of glycolysis takes place in specialized microbodies, the glycosomes. Most glycolytic enzymes of Trypanosoma brucei have been purified and characterized kinetically. In this paper a mathematical model of glycolysis in the bloodstream form of this organism is developed on the basis of all available kinetic data. The fluxes and the cytosolic metabolite concentrations as predicted by the model were in accordance with available data as measured in non-growing trypanosomes, both under aerobic and under anaerobic conditions. The model also reproduced the inhibition of anaerobic glycolysis by glycerol, although the amount of glycerol needed to inhibit glycolysis completely was lower than experimentally determined. At low extracellular glucose concentrations the intracellular glucose concentration remained very low, and only at 5 mM of extracellular glucose, free glucose started to accumulate intracellularly, in close agreement with experimental observations. This biphasic relation could be related to the large difference between the affinities of the glucose transporter and hexokinase for intracellular glucose. The calculated intraglycosomal metabolite concentrations demonstrated that enzymes that have been shown to be near-equilibrium in the cytosol must work far from equilibrium in the glycosome in order to maintain the high glycolytic flux in the latter.},

  Abstract                 = {It has been claimed that proteins with more interaction partners (hubs) are both physiologically more important (i.e., less dispensable) and, owing to an assumed high density of binding sites, slow evolving. Not all analyses, however, support these results, probably because of biased and less-than reliable global protein interaction data. Here we provide the first examination of these issues using a comprehensive literature-curated dataset of well-substantiated protein interactions in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Whereas use of less reliable yeast two-hybrid data alone can reject the possibility that local connectivity correlates with measures of dispensability, in higher quality datasets a relatively robust correlation is observed. In contrast, local connectivity does not correlate with the rate of protein evolution even in reliable datasets. This perhaps surprising lack of correlation with evolutionary rate appears in part to arise from the fact that hub proteins do not have a higher density of residues associated with binding. However, hub proteins do have at least one other set of unusual features, namely rapid turnover and regulation, as manifest in high mRNA decay rates and a large number of phosphorylation sites. This, we suggest, is an adaptation to minimize unwanted activation of pathways that might be mediated by adventitious binding to hubs, were they to actively persist longer than required at any given time point. We conclude that hub proteins are more important for cellular growth rate and under tight regulation but are not slow evolving.},

We describe the design of a class of small trans-acting RNAs that directly regulate gene expression in a ligand-dependent manner. These allosteric riboregulators, which we call antiswitches, are made fully tunable and modular by rational design. They offer flexible control strategies by adopting active or inactive forms in response to ligand binding, depending on their design. They can be tailor-made to regulate the expression of target transcripts in response to different cellular effectors. Coupled with in vitro selection technologies for generating nucleic acid ligand-binding species, antiswitches present a platform for programming cellular behavior and genetic networks with respect to cellular state and environmental stimuli.},

  Abstract                 = {We present a generalised framework for analysing structural robustness of metabolic networks, based on the concept of elementary flux modes (EFMs). Extending our earlier study on single knockouts [Wilhelm, T., Behre, J., Schuster, S., 2004. Analysis of structural robustness of metabolic networks. IEE Proc. Syst. Biol. 1(1), 114-120], we are now considering the general case of double and multiple knockouts. The robustness measures are based on the ratio of the number of remaining EFMs after knockout vs. the number of EFMs in the unperturbed situation, averaged over all combinations of knockouts. With the help of simple examples we demonstrate that consideration of multiple knockouts yields additional information going beyond single-knockout results. It is proven that the robustness score decreases as the knockout depth increases. We apply our extended framework to metabolic networks representing amino acid anabolism in Escherichia coli and human hepatocytes, and the central metabolism in human erythrocytes. Moreover, in the E. coli model the two subnetworks synthesising amino acids that are essential and those that are non-essential for humans are studied separately. The results are discussed from an evolutionary viewpoint. We find that E. coli has the most robust metabolism of all the cell types studied here. Considering only the subnetwork of the synthesis of non-essential amino acids, E. coli and the human hepatocyte show about the same robustness.},

The cells are grown in stable isotope-labeled media to near-complete isotopic enrichment and then extracted in organic solvent containing unlabeled internal standards in known concentrations. The ratio of endogenous metabolite to internal standard in the extract is determined using mass spectrometry (MS). The product of this ratio and the unlabeled standard amount equals the amount of endogenous metabolite present in the cells. The cellular concentration of the metabolite can then be calculated on the basis of intracellular volume of the extracted cells. The protocol is exemplified using Escherichia coli and primary human fibroblasts fed uniformly with (13)C-labeled carbon sources, with detection of (13)C-assimilation by liquid chromatography-tandem MS. It enables absolute quantitation of several dozen metabolites over approximately 1 week of work.},

Thermodynamic models are based on the assumption that the level of gene expression is proportional to the equilibrium probability that RNA polymerase (RNAP) is bound to the promoter of interest. Statistical mechanics provides a framework for computing these probabilities. Within this framework, interactions of activators, repressors, helper molecules and RNAP are described by a single function, the "regulation factor". This analysis culminates in an expression for the probability of RNA polymerase binding at the promoter of interest as a function of the number of regulatory proteins in the cell.},

Thermodynamic models provide a useful framework for the quantitative analysis of bacterial transcription regulation. This framework can facilitate the quantification of vastly different forms of gene expression from several well-characterized bacterial promoters that are regulated by one or two species of transcription factors; it is useful because it requires only a few parameters. As such, it provides a compact description useful for higher-level studies (e.g. of genetic networks) without the need to invoke the biochemical details of every component. Moreover, it can be used to generate hypotheses on the likely mechanisms of transcriptional control.},

If one wants it to fulfil its central role in the new Integrative Neurobiology, the reuse of quantitative models needs to be facilitated. The community has to develop standards and guidelines in order to maximise the diffusion of its scientific production, but also to render it more trustworthy. In the recent years, various projects tackled the problems of the syntax and semantics of quantitative models. More recently the international initiative BioModels.net launched three projects: (1) MIRIAM is a standard to curate and annotate models, in order to facilitate their reuse. (2) The Systems Biology Ontology is a set of controlled vocabularies aimed to be used in conjunction with models, in order to characterise their components. (3) BioModels Database is a resource that allows biologists to store, search and retrieve published mathematical models of biological interests. We expect that those resources, together with the use of formal languages such as SBML, will support the fruitful exchange and reuse of quantitative models.},

In Caulobacter crescentus, two-component signal transduction proteins are crucial for cell cycle regulation, but the connectivity of regulators involved has remained elusive and key factors are unidentified. Here we identify ChpT, an essential histidine phosphotransferase that controls the activity of CtrA, the master cell cycle regulator. We show that the essential histidine kinase CckA initiates two phosphorelays, each requiring ChpT, which lead to the phosphorylation and stabilization of CtrA. Downregulation of CckA activity therefore results in the dephosphorylation and degradation of CtrA, which in turn allow the initiation of DNA replication. Furthermore, we show that CtrA triggers its own destruction by promoting cell division and inducing synthesis of the essential regulator DivK, which feeds back to downregulate CckA immediately before S phase. Our results define a single integrated circuit whose components and connectivity can account for the cell cycle oscillations of CtrA in Caulobacter.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: The development of e-Science presents a major set of opportunities and challenges for the future progress of biological and life scientific research. Major new tools are required and corresponding demands are placed on the high-throughput data generated and used in these processes. Nowhere is the demand greater than in the semantic integration of these data. Semantic Web tools and technologies afford the chance to achieve this semantic integration. Since pathway knowledge is central to much of the scientific research today it is a good test-bed for semantic integration. Within the context of biological pathways, the BioPAX initiative, part of a broader movement towards the standardization and integration of life science databases, forms a necessary prerequisite for its successful application of e-Science in health care and life science research. This paper examines whether BioPAX, an effort to overcome the barrier of disparate and heterogeneous pathway data sources, addresses the needs of e-Science. RESULTS: We demonstrate how BioPAX pathway data can be used to ask and answer some useful biological questions. We find that BioPAX comes close to meeting a broad range of e-Science needs, but certain semantic weaknesses mean that these goals are missed. We make a series of recommendations for re-modeling some aspects of BioPAX to better meet these needs. CONCLUSION: Once these semantic weaknesses are addressed, it will be possible to integrate pathway information in a manner that would be useful in e-Science.},

Combinations of different analytical platforms are therefore required for comprehensive metabolomic studies. Each of these platforms covers only part of the metabolome. To establish multiparallel technologies, thorough standardization of each measured metabolite is required. Standardization is best achieved by addition of a specific stable isotope-labeled compound, a mass isotopomer, for each metabolite. This suggestion, at first glance, seems unrealistic because of cost and time constraints. A possible solution to this problem is discussed in this article. Saturation in vivo labeling with stable isotopes enables the biosynthesis of differentially mass-labeled metabolite mixtures, which can be exploited for highly standardized metabolite profiling by mass isotopomer ratios.},

Comparison with five other sequenced microbes reveals ubiquitous as well as narrowly distributed gene families; many families of similar genes within E. coli are also evident. The largest family of paralogous proteins contains 80 ABC transporters. The genome as a whole is strikingly organized with respect to the local direction of replication; guanines, oligonucleotides possibly related to replication and recombination, and most genes are so oriented. The genome also contains insertion sequence (IS) elements, phage remnants, and many other patches of unusual composition indicating genome plasticity through horizontal transfer.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper reviews top-down regulation analysis, a part of metabolic control analysis, and shows how it can be used to analyse steady states, regulation and homeostasis in complex systems such as energy metabolism in mitochondria, cells and tissues. A steady state is maintained by the variables in a system; regulation is the way the steady state is changed by external effectors. We can exploit the properties of the steady state to measure the kinetic responses (elasticities) of reactions to the concentrations of intermediates and effectors. We can reduce the complexity of the system under investigation by grouping reactions into large blocks connected by a small number of explicit intermediates-this is the top-down approach to control analysis. Simple titrations then yield all the values of elasticities and control coefficients within the system. We can use these values to quantify the relative strengths of different internal pathways that act to keep an intermediate or a rate constant in the steady state. We can also use them to quantify the relative strengths of different primary actions of an external effector and the different internal pathways that transmit its effects through the system, to describe regulation and homeostasis. This top-down regulation analysis has been used to analyse steady states of energy metabolism in mitochondria, cells and tissues, and to analyse regulation of energy metabolism by cadmium, an external effector, in mitochondria. The combination of relatively simple experiments and new theoretical structures for presenting and interpreting the results means that top-down regulation analysis provides a novel and effective way to analyse steady states, regulation and homeostasis in intricate metabolic systems.},

  Abstract                 = {A complete description of the regulation of metabolism in even a single cell will be very hard to achieve, enormous and indigestible. However, there are two powerful ways to simplify the complexity. Firstly, related processes and intermediates can be grouped into a small number of modules, and the regulation of the simplified system can be studied. Secondly, control analysis can be used. With these simplifications to illuminate the important regulatory features, even a full description could be made intellectually and experimentally accessible without distorting the essential regulatory features. Modular control analysis is powerful because it can quantify the relative importance of different flows of regulatory information through any metabolic, physiological, signalling or transcriptional network. It can answer global questions about the importance of different pathways mediating any change to a system. It has been used to analyse how cadmium, a poison with multiple effects, changes oxidative phosphorylation in isolated mitochondria, and to quantify the regulation of energy metabolism in hepatocytes. It has been used to measure how energy metabolism is regulated during mitogen stimulation of thymocytes, quantifying the relative importance of different signalling pathways and how each pathway contributes to the activation of energy metabolism. Recently, we have applied modular control analysis to modern DNA microarray expression profiling to measure the importance of different groups of mRNA transcripts in mediating physiological responses.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND:In the bacterium Caulobacter crescentus, CtrA coordinates DNA replication, cell division, and polar morphogenesis and is considered the cell cycle master regulator. CtrA activity varies during cell cycle progression and is modulated by phosphorylation, proteolysis and transcriptional control. In a phosphorylated state, CtrA binds specific DNA sequences, regulates the expression of genes involved in cell cycle progression and silences the origin of replication. Although the circuitry regulating CtrA is known in molecular detail in Caulobacter, its conservation and functionality in the other alpha-proteobacteria are still poorly understood.RESULTS:Orthologs of Caulobacter factors involved in the regulation of CtrA were systematically scanned in genomes of alpha-proteobacteria. In particular, orthologous genes of the divL-cckA-chpT-ctrA phosphorelay, the divJ-pleC-divK two-component system, the cpdR-rcdA-clpPX proteolysis system, the methyltransferase ccrM and transcriptional regulators dnaA and gcrA were identified in representative genomes of alpha-proteobacteria. CtrA, DnaA and GcrA binding sites and CcrM putative methylation sites were predicted in promoter regions of all these factors and functions controlled by CtrA in all alphas were predicted.CONCLUSIONS:The regulatory cell cycle architecture was identified in all representative alpha-proteobacteria, revealing a high diversification of circuits but also a conservation of logical features. An evolutionary model was proposed where ancient alphas already possessed all modules found in Caulobacter arranged in a variety of connections. Two schemes appeared to evolve: a complex circuit in Caulobacterales and Rhizobiales and a simpler one found in Rhodobacterales.},

  Abstract                 = {A framework is presented that captures the discrete and probabilistic nature of molecular transport and reaction kinetics found in a living cell as well as formally representing the spatial distribution of these phenomena. This particle or agent-based approach is computationally robust and complements established methods. Namely it provides a higher level of spatial resolution than formulations based on ordinary differential equations (ODE) while offering significant advantages in computational efficiency over molecular dynamics (MD). Using this framework, a model cell membrane has been constructed with discrete particle agents that respond to local component interactions that resemble flocking or herding behavioural cues in animals. Results from simulation experiments are presented where this model cell exhibits many of the characteristic behaviours associated with its biological counterpart such as lateral diffusion, response to osmotic pressure gradients, membrane growth and cell division. Lateral diffusion rates and estimates for the membrane modulus of elasticity derived from these simple experiments fall well within a biologically relevant range of values. More importantly, these estimates were obtained by applying a simple qualitative tuning of the model membrane. Membrane growth was simulated by injecting precursor molecules into the proto-cell at different rates and produced a variety of morphologies ranging from a single large cell to a cluster of cells. The computational scalability of this methodology has been tested and results from benchmarking experiments indicate that real-time simulation of a complete bacterial cell will be possible within 10 years.},

  Abstract                 = {Cells receive a wide variety of cellular and environmental signals, which are often processed combinatorially to generate specific genetic responses. Here we explore theoretically the potentials and limitations of combinatorial signal integration at the level of cis-regulatory transcription control. Our analysis suggests that many complex transcription-control functions of the type encountered in higher eukaryotes are already implementable within the much simpler bacterial transcription system. Using a quantitative model of bacterial transcription and invoking only specific protein-DNA interaction and weak glue-like interaction between regulatory proteins, we show explicit schemes to implement regulatory logic functions of increasing complexity by appropriately selecting the strengths and arranging the relative positions of the relevant protein-binding DNA sequences in the cis-regulatory region. The architectures that emerge are naturally modular and evolvable. Our results suggest that the transcription regulatory apparatus is a "programmable" computing machine, belonging formally to the class of Boltzmann machines. Crucial to our results is the ability to regulate gene expression at a distance. In bacteria, this can be achieved for isolated genes via DNA looping controlled by the dimerization of DNA-bound proteins. However, if adopted extensively in the genome, long-distance interaction can cause unintentional intergenic cross talk, a detrimental side effect difficult to overcome by the known bacterial transcription-regulation systems. This may be a key factor limiting the genome-wide adoption of complex transcription control in bacteria. Implications of our findings for combinatorial transcription control in eukaryotes are discussed.},

  Abstract                 = {Protein sequestration occurs when an active protein is sequestered by a repressor into an inactive complex. Using mathematical and computational modeling, we show how this regulatory mechanism (called "molecular titration") can generate ultrasensitive or "all-or-none" responses that are equivalent to highly cooperative processes. The ultrasensitive nature of the input-output response is mainly determined by two parameters: the dimer dissociation constant and the repressor concentration. Because in vivo concentrations are tunable through a variety of mechanisms, molecular titration represents a flexible mechanism for generating ultrasensitivity. Using physiological parameters, we report how details of in vivo protein degradation affect the strength of the ultrasensitivity at steady state. Given that developmental systems often transduce signals into cell-fate decisions on timescales incompatible with steady state, we further examine whether molecular titration can produce ultrasensitive responses within physiologically relevant time intervals. Using Drosophila somatic sex determination as a developmental paradigm, we demonstrate that molecular titration can generate ultrasensitivity on timescales compatible with most cell-fate decisions. Gene duplication followed by loss-of-function mutations can create dominant negatives that titrate and compete with the original protein. Dominant negatives are abundant in gene regulatory circuits, and our results suggest that molecular titration might be generating an ultrasensitive response in these networks.},

We study the role of dimerization reactions in controlling these fluctuations in a simple genetic circuit with negative feedback. We compare two different pathways. In the dimeric pathway the proteins to be regulated form dimers in solution that afterward bind to an operator site and inhibit transcription. In the monomeric pathway monomers bind to the operator site and then recruit another monomer to form a dimer directly on the DNA. We find that while both pathways implement the same negative feedback mechanism, the protein number fluctuations in the dimeric pathway are drastically reduced compared to the monomeric pathway. This difference in the ability to reduce fluctuations may be of importance in the design of genetic networks.},

Alternatively, the concentrations of enzymes required to maintain a given flux may be computed. The program will deal with a network of up to about 30 enzymes.}

  Abstract                 = {We present a quantitative model to demonstrate that coclustering multiple enzymes into compact agglomerates accelerates the processing of intermediates, yielding the same efficiency benefits as direct channeling, a well-known mechanism in which enzymes are funneled between enzyme active sites through a physical tunnel. The model predicts the separation and size of coclusters that maximize metabolic efficiency, and this prediction is in agreement with previously reported spacings between coclusters in mammalian cells. For direct validation, we study a metabolic branch point in Escherichia coli and experimentally confirm the model prediction that enzyme agglomerates can accelerate the processing of a shared intermediate by one branch, and thus regulate steady-state flux division. Our studies establish a quantitative framework to understand coclustering-mediated metabolic channeling and its application to both efficiency improvement and metabolic regulation.},

  Abstract                 = {Recent ChIP experiments of human and mouse embryonic stem cells have elucidated the architecture of the transcriptional regulatory circuitry responsible for cell determination, which involves the transcription factors OCT4, SOX2, and NANOG. In addition to regulating each other through feedback loops, these genes also regulate downstream target genes involved in the maintenance and differentiation of embryonic stem cells. A search for the OCT4-SOX2-NANOG network motif in other species reveals that it is unique to mammals. With a kinetic modeling approach, we ascribe function to the observed OCT4-SOX2-NANOG network by making plausible assumptions about the interactions between the transcription factors at the gene promoter binding sites and RNA polymerase (RNAP), at each of the three genes as well as at the target genes. We identify a bistable switch in the network, which arises due to several positive feedback loops, and is switched on/off by input environmental signals. The switch stabilizes the expression levels of the three genes, and through their regulatory roles on the downstream target genes, leads to a binary decision: when OCT4, SOX2, and NANOG are expressed and the switch is on, the self-renewal genes are on and the differentiation genes are off. The opposite holds when the switch is off. The model is extremely robust to parameter changes. In addition to providing a self-consistent picture of the transcriptional circuit, the model generates several predictions. Increasing the binding strength of NANOG to OCT4 and SOX2, or increasing its basal transcriptional rate, leads to an irreversible bistable switch: the switch remains on even when the activating signal is removed. Hence, the stem cell can be manipulated to be self-renewing without the requirement of input signals. We also suggest tests that could discriminate between a variety of feedforward regulation architectures of the target genes by OCT4, SOX2, and NANOG.},

  Abstract                 = {There have been a growing number of observations of oscillating protein levels (p53 and NFkB) in eukaryotic signalling pathways. This has resulted in a renewed interest in the mechanism by which such oscillations might occur. Recent computational work has shown that a multisite phosphorylation mechanism such as that found in the MAPK cascade can theoretically exhibit bistability. The bistable behavior was shown to arise from sequestration and saturation mechanisms for the enzymes that catalyse the multisite phosphorylation cycle. These effects generate the positive feedback necessary for bistability. In this paper we describe two kinds of oscillatory dynamics which can occur in a network by which, both use such bistable multisite phosphorylated cycles. In the first example, the fully phosphorylated form of the phosphorylated cycle represses the production of the kinase, which carries out the phosphorylation of the unphosphorylated states of the cycle. The dynamics of this system leads to a relaxation oscillator. In the second example, we consider a cascade of two cycles, in which the fully phosphorylated form of the kinase, in the first cycle, phosphorylates the unphosphorylated forms in the second cycle. A feedback loop, by which the fully phosphorylated form of the second cycle inhibits the kinase step in the first cycle is also present. In this case we obtain a ring oscillator. Both these networks illustrate the versatility of the multisite bistable network.},

  Abstract                 = {Neurotransmitter release is well known to occur at specialized synaptic regions that include presynaptic active zones and postsynaptic densities. At cholinergic synapses in the chick ciliary ganglion, however, membrane formations and physiological measurements suggest that release distant from postsynaptic densities can activate the predominantly extrasynaptic alpha7 nicotinic receptor subtype. We explored such ectopic neurotransmission with a novel model synapse that combines Monte Carlo simulations with high-resolution serial electron microscopic tomography. Simulated synaptic activity is consistent with experimental recordings of miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents only when ectopic transmission is included in the model, broadening the possibilities for mechanisms of neuronal communication.},

RESULTS: We outline here a conceptual basis for designing such a language and describe BioD, a prototype language that we have used to explore the utility and feasibility of this approach to functional biology. Using example models, we demonstrate that a rather limited lexicon of icons and arrows suffices to describe complex cell-biological systems as discrete models that can be posted and linked on the internet. CONCLUSIONS: Given available computer and internet technology, BioD may be implemented as an extensible, multidisciplinary language that can be used to archive functional systems knowledge and be extended to support both qualitative and quantitative functional analysis.},

We discuss numerical issues with these features; in particular, the criteria to switch between stochastic and deterministic simulation methods, hybrid deterministic-stochastic methods, and the importance of random number generator numerical resolution in stochastic simulation.

  Abstract                 = {The transcriptional regulatory machinery of a gene can be viewed as a computational device, with transcription factor concentrations as inputs and expression level as the output. This view begs the question: what kinds of computations are possible? We show that different parameterizations of a simple chemical kinetic model of transcriptional regulation are able to approximate all four standard arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, as well as various equality and inequality operations. This contrasts with other studies that emphasize logical or digital notions of computation in biological networks. We analyze the accuracy and precision of these approximations, showing that they depend on different sets of parameters, and are thus independently tunable. We demonstrate that networks of these "arithmetic" genes can be combined to accomplish yet more complicated computations by designing and simulating a network that detects statistically significant elevations in a time-varying signal. We also consider the much more general problem of approximating analytic functions, showing that this can be achieved by allowing multiple transcription factor binding sites on the promoter. These observations are important for the interpretation of naturally occurring networks and imply new possibilities for the design of synthetic networks.},

  Abstract                 = {Typically differential equations are employed to simulate cellular dynamics. To develop a valid continuous model based on differential equations requires accurate parameter estimations; an accuracy which is often difficult to achieve, due to the lack of data. In addition, processes in metabolic pathways, e.g. metabolite channeling, seem to be of a rather qualitative and discrete nature. With respect to the available data and to the perception of the underlying system, a discrete rather than a continuous approach to modeling and simulation seems more adequate. A discrete approach does not necessarily imply a more abstract view on the system. If we move from macro to micro and multi-level modeling, aspects of subsystems and their interactions, which have been only implicitly represented, become an explicit part of the model. To start exploring discrete event phenomena within metabolite channeling we choose the tryptophan synthase. Based on a continuous macro model, a discrete event, multi-level model is developed which allows us to analyze the interrelation between structural and functional characteristics of the enzymes.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: Metabolomics, i.e., the multiparallel analysis of metabolite changes occurring in a cell or an organism, has become feasible with the development of highly efficient mass spectroscopic technologies. Functional genomics as a standard tool helped to identify the function of many of the genes that encode important transporters and metabolic enzymes over the past few years. Advanced expression systems and analysis technologies made it possible to study the biochemical properties of the corresponding proteins in great detail. We begin to understand the biological functions of the gene products by systematic analysis of mutants using systematic PTGS/RNAi, knockout and TILLING approaches. However, one crucial set of data especially relevant in the case of multicellular organisms is lacking: the knowledge of the spatial and temporal profiles of metabolite levels at cellular and subcellular levels. METHODS: We therefore developed genetically encoded nanosensors for several metabolites to provide a basic set of tools for the determination of cytosolic and subcellular metabolite levels in real time by using fluorescence microscopy. RESULTS: Prototypes of these sensors were successfully used in vitro and also in vivo, i.e., to measure sugar levels in fungal and animal cells. CONCLUSIONS: One of the future goals will be to expand the set of sensors to a wider spectrum of substrates by using the natural spectrum of periplasmic binding proteins from bacteria and by computational design of proteins with altered binding pockets in conjunction with mutagenesis. This toolbox can then be applied for four-dimensional imaging of cells and tissues to elucidate the spatial and temporal distribution of metabolites as a discovery tool in functional genomics, as a tool for high-throughput, high-content screening for drugs, to test metabolic models, and to analyze the interplay of cells in a tissue or organ.},

  Abstract                 = {The intracellular environment of a cell hosts a wide variety of enzymatic reactions, diffusion events, molecular binding, polymerization and metabolic channeling. To transform these biological events into a computational framework, distinct modeling strategies are required. While currently no tool is capable of capturing all these events, progress is being made to create an integrated environment for the modeling community. To address this niche requirement, Cellware has been developed to offer a multi-algorithmic environment for modeling and simulating both deterministic and stochastic events in the cell.

  Abstract                 = {Isotope labeling networks (ILNs) are graphs explaining the flow of isotope labeled molecules in a metabolic network. Moreover, they are the structural backbone of metabolic flux analysis (MFA) by isotopic tracers which has been established as a standard experimental tool in fluxomics. To configure an isotope labeling experiment (ILE) for MFA, the structure of the corresponding ILN must be understood to a certain extent even by a practitioner. Graph algorithms help to analyze the network structure but produce rather abstract results. Here, the major obstruction is the high dimension of these networks and the large number of network components which, consequently, are hard to figure out manually. At the interface between theory and experiment, the three-dimensional interactive visualization tool CumoVis has been developed for exploring the network structure in a step by step manner. Navigation and orientation within ILNs are supported by exploiting the natural 3D structure of an underlying metabolite network with stacked labeled particles on top of each metabolite node. Network exploration is facilitated by rotating, zooming, forward and backward path tracing and, most important, network component reduction. All features of CumoVis are explained with an educational example and a realistic network describing carbon flow in the citric acid cycle.},

  Abstract                 = {Engineered metabolic pathways constructed from enzymes heterologous to the production host often suffer from flux imbalances, as they typically lack the regulatory mechanisms characteristic of natural metabolism. In an attempt to increase the effective concentration of each component of a pathway of interest, we built synthetic protein scaffolds that spatially recruit metabolic enzymes in a designable manner. Scaffolds bearing interaction domains from metazoan signaling proteins specifically accrue pathway enzymes tagged with their cognate peptide ligands. The natural modularity of these domains enabled us to optimize the stoichiometry of three mevalonate biosynthetic enzymes recruited to a synthetic complex and thereby achieve 77-fold improvement in product titer with low enzyme expression and reduced metabolic load. One of the same scaffolds was used to triple the yield of glucaric acid, despite high titers (0.5 g/l) without the synthetic complex. These strategies should prove generalizeable to other metabolic pathways and programmable for fine-tuning pathway flux.},

  Abstract                 = {Glycolytic fluxes in resting Escherichia coli were enhanced by overexpression of heterologous pyruvate kinases (Pyk) from Bacillus stearothermophilus and Zymomonas mobilis, but not homologous Pyk. Compared to the control, an increase of 10\% in specific glucose consumption and of 15\% in specific ethanol production rates was found in anaerobic resting cells, expressing the heterologous Pyks, that were harvested from exponentially growing aerobic cultures. A further increase in glycolytic flux was achieved by simultaneous overexpression of E. coli phosphofructokinase (Pfk) and Pyk with specific glucose consumption and ethanol production rates of 25\% and 35\% greater, respectively, than the control. Fluxes to lactate were not significantly affected, contrary to previous observations with resting cells harvested from anaerobically growing cultures. To correlate the physiology of resting cells with the physiology of cells prior to harvest, we determined the relevant growth parameters from aerobic and anaerobic precultures. We conclude that glycolytic fluxes in E. coli with submaximal (aerobic) metabolic activity can be increased by overexpression of pyruvate kinases which do not require allosteric activation or co-overexpression with Pfk. However, such improvements require more extensive engineering in E. coli with near maximal (anaerobic) metabolic activity.},

However it is difficult to check the correctness of a stochastic simulator, since any two realisations from a single model will typically be different. RESULTS: We have developed a test suite of stochastic models which have been solved either analytically or using numerical methods. This allows the accuracy of stochastic simulators to be tested against known results. The test suite is already being used by a number of stochastic simulator developers.

  Abstract                 = {Systems analysis of metabolic and growth functions in microbial organisms is rapidly developing and maturing. Such studies are enabled by reconstruction, at the genomic scale, of the biochemical reaction networks that underlie cellular processes. The network reconstruction process is organism specific and is based on an annotated genome sequence, high-throughput network-wide data sets and bibliomic data on the detailed properties of individual network components. Here we describe the process that is currently used to achieve comprehensive network reconstructions and discuss how these reconstructions are curated and validated. This review should aid the growing number of researchers who are carrying out reconstructions for particular target organisms.},

  Abstract                 = {Protein-protein interactions between two proteins have generally been studied using biochemical techniques such as crosslinking, co-immunoprecipitation and co-fractionation by chromatography. We have generated a novel genetic system to study these interactions by taking advantage of the properties of the GAL4 protein of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. This protein is a transcriptional activator required for the expression of genes encoding enzymes of galactose utilization. It consists of two separable and functionally essential domains: an N-terminal domain which binds to specific DNA sequences (UASG); and a C-terminal domain containing acidic regions, which is necessary to activate transcription. We have generated a system of two hybrid proteins containing parts of GAL4: the GAL4 DNA-binding domain fused to a protein 'X' and a GAL4 activating region fused to a protein 'Y'. If X and Y can form a protein-protein complex and reconstitute proximity of the GAL4 domains, transcription of a gene regulated by UASG occurs. We have tested this system using two yeast proteins that are known to interact--SNF1 and SNF4. High transcriptional activity is obtained only when both hybrids are present in a cell. This system may be applicable as a general method to identify proteins that interact with a known protein by the use of a simple galactose selection.}

  Abstract                 = {Autonomous oscillations found in gene expression and metabolic, cardiac and neuronal systems have attracted significant attention both because of their obvious biological roles and their intriguing dynamics. In addition, de novo designed oscillators have been demonstrated, using components that are not part of the natural oscillators. Such oscillators are useful in testing the design principles and in exploring potential applications not limited by natural cellular behaviour. To achieve transcriptional and metabolic integration characteristic of natural oscillators, here we designed and constructed a synthetic circuit in Escherichia coli K12, using glycolytic flux to generate oscillation through the signalling metabolite acetyl phosphate. If two metabolite pools are interconverted by two enzymes that are placed under the transcriptional control of acetyl phosphate, the system oscillates when the glycolytic rate exceeds a critical value. We used bifurcation analysis to identify the boundaries of oscillation, and verified these experimentally. This work demonstrates the possibility of using metabolic flux as a control factor in system-wide oscillation, as well as the predictability of a de novo gene-metabolic circuit designed using nonlinear dynamic analysis.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: Metabolic pathway analysis has been recognized as a central approach to the structural analysis of metabolic networks. The concept of elementary (flux) modes provides a rigorous formalism to describe and assess pathways and has proven to be valuable for many applications. However, computing elementary modes is a hard computational task. In recent years we assisted in a multiplication of algorithms dedicated to it. We require a summarizing point of view and a continued improvement of the current methods. RESULTS: We show that computing the set of elementary modes is equivalent to computing the set of extreme rays of a convex cone. This standard mathematical representation provides a unified framework that encompasses the most prominent algorithmic methods that compute elementary modes and allows a clear comparison between them. Taking lessons from this benchmark, we here introduce a new method, the binary approach, which computes the elementary modes as binary patterns of participating reactions from which the respective stoichiometric coefficients can be computed in a post-processing step. We implemented the binary approach in FluxAnalyzer 5.1, a software that is free for academics. The binary approach decreases the memory demand up to 96\% without loss of speed giving the most efficient method available for computing elementary modes to date. CONCLUSIONS: The equivalence between elementary modes and extreme ray computations offers opportunities for employing tools from polyhedral computation for metabolic pathway analysis. The new binary approach introduced herein was derived from this general theoretical framework and facilitates the computation of elementary modes in considerably larger networks.},

This paper summarizes the improvements, new biology and new features available in version 6.0. Curation of original literature is, from now on, up to date for every new release. All the objects are supported by their corresponding evidences, now classified as strong or weak. Transcription factors are classified by origin of their effectors and by gene ontology class. We have now computational predictions for sigma(54) and five different promoter types of the sigma(70) family, as well as their corresponding -10 and -35 boxes. In addition to those curated from the literature, we added about 300 experimentally mapped promoters coming from our own high-throughput mapping efforts. RegulonDB v.6.0 now expands beyond transcription initiation, including RNA regulatory elements, specifically riboswitches, attenuators and small RNAs, with their known associated targets. The data can be accessed through overviews of correlations about gene regulation. RegulonDB associated original literature, together with more than 4000 curation notes, can now be searched with the Textpresso text mining engine.},

Through systematic tagging of open reading frames (ORFs), the majority of complexes were purified several times, suggesting screen saturation. The richness of the data set enabled a de novo characterization of the composition and organization of the cellular machinery. The ensemble of cellular proteins partitions into 491 complexes, of which 257 are novel, that differentially combine with additional attachment proteins or protein modules to enable a diversification of potential functions. Support for this modular organization of the proteome comes from integration with available data on expression, localization, function, evolutionary conservation, protein structure and binary interactions. This study provides the largest collection of physically determined eukaryotic cellular machines so far and a platform for biological data integration and modelling.},

  Abstract                 = {Understanding the dynamics and variability of protein circuitry requires accurate measurements in living cells as well as theoretical models. To address this, we employed one of the best-studied protein circuits in human cells, the negative feedback loop between the tumor suppressor p53 and the oncogene Mdm2. We measured the dynamics of fluorescently tagged p53 and Mdm2 over several days in individual living cells. We found that isogenic cells in the same environment behaved in highly variable ways following DNA-damaging gamma irradiation: some cells showed undamped oscillations for at least 3 days (more than 10 peaks). The amplitude of the oscillations was much more variable than the period. Sister cells continued to oscillate in a correlated way after cell division, but lost correlation after about 11 h on average. Other cells showed low-frequency fluctuations that did not resemble oscillations. We also analyzed different families of mathematical models of the system, including a novel checkpoint mechanism. The models point to the possible source of the variability in the oscillations: low-frequency noise in protein production rates, rather than noise in other parameters such as degradation rates. This study provides a view of the extensive variability of the behavior of a protein circuit in living human cells, both from cell to cell and in the same cell over time.},

  Abstract                 = {Stochastic chemical kinetics describes the time evolution of a well-stirred chemically reacting system in a way that takes into account the fact that molecules come in whole numbers and exhibit some degree of randomness in their dynamical behavior. Researchers are increasingly using this approach to chemical kinetics in the analysis of cellular systems in biology, where the small molecular populations of only a few reactant species can lead to deviations from the predictions of the deterministic differential equations of classical chemical kinetics. After reviewing the supporting theory of stochastic chemical kinetics, I discuss some recent advances in methods for using that theory to make numerical simulations. These include improvements to the exact stochastic simulation algorithm (SSA) and the approximate explicit tau-leaping procedure, as well as the development of two approximate strategies for simulating systems that are dynamically stiff: implicit tau-leaping and the slow-scale SSA.},

RESULTS: A computer framework is described which allows the building of modularly structured models using an abstract, modular and general modeling methodology. With this methodology, reusable modeling entities are introduced which lead to the development of a modeling library within the modeling tool ProMot. The simulation environment Diva is used for numerical analysis and parameter identification of the models. The simulation environment provides a number of tools and algorithms to simulate and analyze complex biochemical networks. The described tools are the first steps towards an integrated computer-based modeling, simulation and visualization environment Availability: Available on request to the authors. The software itself is free for scientific purposes but requires commercial libraries. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: http://www.mpi-magdeburg.mpg.de/projects/promot},

  Abstract                 = {A ubiquitous building block of signaling pathways is a cycle of covalent modification (e.g., phosphorylation and dephosphorylation in MAPK cascades). Our paper explores the kind of information processing and filtering that can be accomplished by this simple biochemical circuit. Signaling cycles are particularly known for exhibiting a highly sigmoidal (ultrasensitive) input-output characteristic in a certain steady-state regime. Here, we systematically study the cycle's steady-state behavior and its response to time-varying stimuli. We demonstrate that the cycle can actually operate in four different regimes, each with its specific input-output characteristics. These results are obtained using the total quasi-steady-state approximation, which is more generally valid than the typically used Michaelis-Menten approximation for enzymatic reactions. We invoke experimental data that suggest the possibility of signaling cycles operating in one of the new regimes. We then consider the cycle's dynamic behavior, which has so far been relatively neglected. We demonstrate that the intrinsic architecture of the cycles makes them act--in all four regimes--as tunable low-pass filters, filtering out high-frequency fluctuations or noise in signals and environmental cues. Moreover, the cutoff frequency can be adjusted by the cell. Numerical simulations show that our analytical results hold well even for noise of large amplitude. We suggest that noise filtering and tunability make signaling cycles versatile components of more elaborate cell-signaling pathways.},

  Abstract                 = {The ability to construct synthetic gene networks enables experimental investigations of deliberately simplified systems that can be compared to qualitative and quantitative models. If simple, well-characterized modules can be coupled together into more complex networks with behaviour that can be predicted from that of the individual components, we may begin to build an understanding of cellular regulatory processes from the 'bottom up'. Here we have engineered a promoter to allow simultaneous repression and activation of gene expression in Escherichia coli. We studied its behaviour in synthetic gene networks under increasingly complex conditions: unregulated, repressed, activated, and simultaneously repressed and activated. We develop a stochastic model that quantitatively captures the means and distributions of the expression from the engineered promoter of this modular system, and show that the model can be extended and used to accurately predict the in vivo behaviour of the network when it is expanded to include positive feedback. The model also reveals the counterintuitive prediction that noise in protein expression levels can increase upon arrest of cell growth and division, which we confirm experimentally. This work shows that the properties of regulatory subsystems can be used to predict the behaviour of larger, more complex regulatory networks, and that this bottom-up approach can provide insights into gene regulation.},

  Abstract                 = {For many metabolic systems, available experimental data allow description of the system by elasticities and control coefficients. The availability of information of this kind motivated the development of a (log)linear kinetic model of metabolic systems that is completely and explicitly determined by this information. It is shown here that this model can accurately describe the dynamic responses of metabolic systems that exhibit strong nonlinearities. Based on the excellent approximation provided by the (log)linear model, a method is developed for the estimation of the performance of metabolic systems subject to spatiotemporal variations of the system parameters and the process operating conditions. The method suggests experiments that can quantify the effect of these variations. Study of a model glycolytic pathway illustrates the applicability and the usefulness of this framework. Time-average flux control coefficients are shown to vary strongly and not monotonically as the period of the external variations changes.},

  Abstract                 = {An overview is presented of the different approximative enzyme kinetic formats that have been proposed for use in metabolic modeling studies. It is considered that the following four general properties are relevant for approximative kinetics: the rate must be proportional to enzyme level; at high metabolite concentrations, there is downward concave behavior of rate versus concentration; the number of kinetic parameters should be as small as possible; analytical solutions of steady-state network balances are desirable. Six different approximative kinetic formats are evaluated (linear, logarithmic-linear, power law GMA, power law S-systems, thermokinetic, linear-logarithmic) and it is concluded that only the recently proposed linear-logarithmic approach combines all desired properties and therefore seems a most appropriate approximate kinetic format.},

  Abstract                 = {Genome-scale metabolic models have proven to be valuable for predicting organism phenotypes from genotypes. Yet efforts to develop new models are failing to keep pace with genome sequencing. To address this problem, we introduce the Model SEED, a web-based resource for high-throughput generation, optimization and analysis of genome-scale metabolic models. The Model SEED integrates existing methods and introduces techniques to automate nearly every step of this process, taking approximately 48 h to reconstruct a metabolic model from an assembled genome sequence. We apply this resource to generate 130 genome-scale metabolic models representing a taxonomically diverse set of bacteria. Twenty-two of the models were validated against available gene essentiality and Biolog data, with the average model accuracy determined to be 66% before optimization and 87% after optimization.},

  abstract = {We show how metabolic regulation as commonly understood in biochemistry can be described in terms of metabolic control analysis. The steady-state values of the variables of metabolic systems (fluxes and concentrations) are determined by a set of parameters. Some of these parameters are concentrations that are set by the environment of the system; they can act as external regulators by communicating changes in the environment to the metabolic system. How effectively a system is regulated depends both on the degree to which the activity of the regulatory enzyme with which a regulator interacts directly can be altered by the regulator (its regulability) and on the ability of the regulatory enzyme to transmit the changes to the rest of the system (its regulatory capacity). The regulatory response of a system also depends on its internal organisation around key variable metabolites that act as internal regulators. The regulatory performance of the system can be judged in terms of how sensitivity the fluxes respond to the external stimulus and to what degree homeostasis in the concentrations of the internal regulators is maintained. We show how, on the level of both external and internal regulation, regulability can be quantified in terms of an elasticity coefficient and regulatory capacity in terms of a control coefficient. Metabolic regulation can therefore be described in terms of metabolic control analysis. The combined response relationship of control analysis relates regulability and regulatory capacity and allows quantification of the regulatory importance of the various interactions of regulators with enzymes in the system. On this basis we propose a quantitative terminology and analysis of metabolic regulation that shows what we should measure experimentally and how we should interpret the results. Analysis and numerical simulation of a simple model system serves to demonstrate our treatment.},

Supply-demand analysis allows the behaviour, control and regulation of metabolism as a whole to be understood quantitatively in terms of the elasticities of supply and demand, which are experimentally measurable properties of the individual blocks. The kinetic and thermodynamic aspects of regulation are clearly distinguished. One important result is the demonstration that when flux is controlled by one block, the other block determines to which degree the concentration of the linking metabolite is homeostatically maintained.},

  abstract = {The living cell can be thought of as a collection of linked chemical factories, a molecular economy in which the principles of supply and demand obtain. Supply-demand analysis is a framework for exploring and gaining an understanding of metabolic regulation, both theoretically and experimentally, where regulatory performance is measured in terms of flux control and homeostatic maintenance of metabolite concentrations. It is based on a metabolic control analysis of a supply-demand system in steady state in which the degree of flux and concentration control by the supply and demand blocks is related to their local properties, which are quantified as the elasticities of supply and demand. These elasticities can be visualized as the slopes of the log-log rate characteristics of supply and demand. Rate characteristics not only provide insight about system behavior around the steady state but can also be expanded to provide a view of the behavior of the system over a wide range of concentrations of the metabolic intermediate that links the supply and the demand. The theoretical and experimental results of supply-demand analysis paint a picture of the regulatory design of metabolic systems that differs radically from what can be called the classical view of metabolic regulation, which generally explains the role of regulatory mechanisms only in terms of the supply, completely ignoring the demand. Supply-demand analysis has recently been generalized into a computational tool that can be used to study the regulatory behavior of kinetic models of metabolic systems up to genome-scale.},

  Abstract                 = {A possible basis for a quantitative theory of metabolic regulation is outlined. Regulation is defined here as the alteration of reaction properties to augment or counteract the mass-action trend in a network reactions. In living systems the enzymes that catalyze these reactions are the "handles" through which such alteration is effected. It is shown how the elasticity coefficients of an enzyme-catalyzed reaction with respect to substrates and products are the sum of a mass-action term and a regulatory kinetic term; these coefficients therefore distinguish between mass-action effects and regulatory effects and are recognized as the key to quantifying regulation. As elasticity coefficients are also basic ingredients of metabolic control analysis, it is possible to relate regulation to such concepts as control, signalling, stability, and homeostasis. The need for care in the choice of relative or absolute changes when considering questions of metabolic regulation is stressed. Although the concepts are illustrated in terms of a simple coupled reaction system, they apply equally to more complex systems. When such systems are divided into reaction blocks, co-response coefficients can be used to measure the elasticities of these blocks.},

This generally implies that co-response analysis is also general, i.e. that all of the elasticities and all of the control coefficients in any system, regardless of branching, feedback effects, moiety conservation or other complications, can be determined by comparing the effects of perturbations of the enzyme activities on the steady-state fluxes and concentrations of the pathway. The approach requires no quantitative information about the magnitudes of the effects on the individual enzyme activities, and consequently no enzymes need to be studied in isolation from the pathway.},

Different modification mechanisms are analysed: mixed inhibition, allosteric inhibition and activation of the reversible Monod-Wyman-Changeux and reversible Hill models. In conclusion, it is shown that, whereas a modifier effect on substrate and product binding (specific effects) can be an effective negative feedback mechanism, it is much less effective as a positive feedforward mechanism. The prediction is that catalytic effects that change the apparent limiting velocity would be more effective in feedforward activation.},

  Abstract                 = {Cellular functions are ultimately linked to metabolic fluxes brought about by thousands of chemical reactions and transport processes. The synthesis of the underlying enzymes and membrane transporters causes the cell a certain 'effort' of energy and external resources. Considering that those cells should have had a selection advantage during natural evolution that enabled them to fulfil vital functions (such as growth, defence against toxic compounds, repair of DNA alterations, etc.) with minimal effort, one may postulate the principle of flux minimization, as follows: given the available external substrates and given a set of functionally important 'target' fluxes required to accomplish a specific pattern of cellular functions, the stationary metabolic fluxes have to become a minimum. To convert this principle into a mathematical method enabling the prediction of stationary metabolic fluxes, the total flux in the network is measured by a weighted linear combination of all individual fluxes whereby the thermodynamic equilibrium constants are used as weighting factors, i.e. the more the thermodynamic equilibrium lies on the right-hand side of the reaction, the larger the weighting factor for the backward reaction. A linear programming technique is applied to minimize the total flux at fixed values of the target fluxes and under the constraint of flux balance (= steady-state conditions) with respect to all metabolites. The theoretical concept is applied to two metabolic schemes: the energy and redox metabolism of erythrocytes, and the central metabolism of Methylobacterium extorquens AM1. The flux rates predicted by the flux-minimization method exhibit significant correlations with flux rates obtained by either kinetic modelling or direct experimental determination. Larger deviations occur for segments of the network composed of redundant branches where the flux-minimization method always attributes the total flux to the thermodynamically most favourable branch. Nevertheless, compared with existing methods of structural modelling, the principle of flux minimization appears to be a promising theoretical approach to assess stationary flux rates in metabolic systems in cases where a detailed kinetic model is not yet available.},

Here a generalization of this method is proposed that takes into account possible limitations of internal fluxes, e.g. due to enzyme defects or partial inhibition of enzyme activities by drugs. The generalized method consists in the minimization of an objective function which expresses the compromise that has to be made between minimization of internal fluxes on one hand and maintenance of the metabolic output required for various cellular functions on the other. Fulfillment of the latter condition is measured through a fitness function, which evaluates the relative deviation of the output fluxes from demanded target values. The method is applied to assess the metabolic consequences caused by a deficiency of enzymes involved in the metabolism of erythrocytes. The obtained results are in good agreement with those obtained on the basis of a comprehensive kinetic model.},

  Abstract                 = {Interactions between genes and proteins are crucial for efficient processing of internal or external signals, but this connectivity also amplifies stochastic fluctuations by propagating noise between components. Linear (unbranched) cascades were shown to exhibit an interplay between the sensitivity to changes in input signals and the ability to buffer noise. We searched for biological circuits that can maintain signaling sensitivity while minimizing noise propagation, focusing on cases where the noise is characterized by rapid fluctuations. Negative feedback can buffer this type of noise, but this buffering comes at the expense of an even greater reduction in signaling sensitivity. By systematically analyzing three-component circuits, we identify positive feedback as a central motif allowing for the buffering of propagated noise while maintaining sensitivity to long-term changes in input signals. We show analytically that noise reduction in the presence of positive feedback results from improved averaging of rapid fluctuations over time, and discuss in detail a particular implementation in the control of nutrient homeostasis in yeast. As the design of biological networks optimizes for multiple constraints, positive feedback can be used to improve sensitivity without a compromise in the ability to buffer propagated noise.},

In all of these polyfunctional enzymes, a product formed from the catalytic reaction at one active site is a substrate for an enzymatic reaction at a distal active site. Reaction intermediates are translocated from one active site to the next through the participation of an intermolecular tunnel. The tunnel in tryptophan synthase is approximately 25 A in length, whereas the tunnel in carbamoyl phosphate synthetase is nearly 100 A long. Kinetic studies have demonstrated that the individual reactions are coordinated through allosteric coupling of one active site with another. The participation of these molecular tunnels is thought to protect reactive intermediates from coming in contact with the external medium.},

  Abstract                 = {A complex hierarchy of genetic interactions converts a single-celled Drosophila melanogaster egg into a multicellular embryo with 14 segments. Previously, von Dassow et al. reported that a mathematical model of the genetic interactions that defined the polarity of segments (the segment polarity network) was robust (von Dassow et al. 2000). As quantitative information about the system was unavailable, parameters were sampled randomly. A surprisingly large fraction of these parameter sets allowed the model to maintain and elaborate on the segment polarity pattern. This robustness is due to the positive feedback of gene products on their own expression, which induces individual cells in a model segment to adopt different stable expression states (bistability) corresponding to different cell types in the segment polarity pattern. A positive feedback loop will only yield multiple stable states when the parameters that describe it satisfy a particular inequality. By testing which random parameter sets satisfy these inequalities, I show that bistability is necessary to form the segment polarity pattern and serves as a strong predictor of which parameter sets will succeed in forming the pattern. Although the original model was robust to parameter variation, it could not reproduce the observed effects of cell division on the pattern of gene expression. I present a modified version that incorporates recent experimental evidence and does successfully mimic the consequences of cell division. The behavior of this modified model can also be understood in terms of bistability in positive feedback of gene expression. I discuss how this topological property of networks provides robust pattern formation and how large changes in parameters can change the specific pattern produced by a network.},

  Abstract                 = {Metabolic flux analysis using carbon labeling experiments (CLEs) is an important tool in metabolic engineering where the intracellular fluxes have to be computed from the measured extracellular fluxes and the partially measured distribution of 13C labeling within the intracellular metabolite pools. The relation between unknown fluxes and measurements is described by an isotopomer labeling system (ILS) (see Part I [Math. Biosci. 169 (2001) 173]). Part II deals with the structural flux identifiability of measured ILSs in the steady state. The central question is whether the measured data contains sufficient information to determine the unknown intracellular fluxes. This question has to be decided a priori, i.e. before the CLE is carried out. In structural identifiability analysis the measurements are assumed to be noise-free. A general theory of structural flux identifiability for measured ILSs is presented and several algorithms are developed to solve the identifiability problem. In the particular case of maximal measurement information, a symbolical algorithm is presented that decides the identifiability question by means of linear methods. Several upper bounds of the number of identifiable fluxes are derived, and the influence of the chosen inputs is evaluated. By introducing integer arithmetic this algorithm can even be applied to large networks. For the general case of arbitrary measurement information, identifiability is decided by a local criterion. A new algorithm based on integer arithmetic enables an a priori local identifiability analysis to be performed for networks of arbitrary size. All algorithms have been implemented and flux identifiability is investigated for the network of the central metabolic pathways of a microorganism. Moreover, several small examples are worked out to illustrate the influence of input metabolite labeling and the paradox of information loss due to network simplification.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: Knowledge about the abundance of molecular components is an important prerequisite for building quantitative predictive models of cellular behavior. Proteins are central components of these models, since they carry out most of the fundamental processes in the cell. Thus far, protein concentrations have been difficult to measure on a large scale, but proteomic technologies have now advanced to a stage where this information becomes readily accessible. RESULTS: Here, we describe an experimental scheme to maximize the coverage of proteins identified by mass spectrometry of a complex biological sample. Using a combination of LC-MS/MS approaches with protein and peptide fractionation steps we identified 1103 proteins from the cytosolic fraction of the Escherichia coli strain MC4100. A measure of abundance is presented for each of the identified proteins, based on the recently developed emPAI approach which takes into account the number of sequenced peptides per protein. The values of abundance are within a broad range and accurately reflect independently measured copy numbers per cell. As expected, the most abundant proteins were those involved in protein synthesis, most notably ribosomal proteins. Proteins involved in energy metabolism as well as those with binding function were also found in high copy number while proteins annotated with the terms metabolism, transcription, transport, and cellular organization were rare. The barrel-sandwich fold was found to be the structural fold with the highest abundance. Highly abundant proteins are predicted to be less prone to aggregation based on their length, pI values, and occurrence patterns of hydrophobic stretches. We also find that abundant proteins tend to be predominantly essential. Additionally we observe a significant correlation between protein and mRNA abundance in E. coli cells. CONCLUSION: Abundance measurements for more than 1000 E. coli proteins presented in this work represent the most complete study of protein abundance in a bacterial cell so far. We show significant associations between the abundance of a protein and its properties and functions in the cell. In this way, we provide both data and novel insights into the role of protein concentration in this model organism.},

  Abstract                 = {Gene regulatory networks contain several substructures called network motifs, which frequently exist throughout the networks. One of such motifs found in Escherichia coli, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and Drosophila melanogaster is the feed-forward loop, in which an effector regulates its target by a direct regulatory interaction and an indirect interaction mediated by another gene product. Here, we theoretically analyze the behavior of networks that contain feed-forward loops cross talking to each other. In response to levels of the effecter, such networks can generate multiple rise-and-fall temporal expression profiles and spatial stripes, which are typically observed in developmental processes. The mechanism to generate these responses reveals the way of inferring the regulatory pathways from experimental results. Our database study of gene regulatory networks indicates that most feed-forward loops actually cross talk. We discuss how the feed-forward loops and their cross talks can play important roles in morphogenesis.},

  Abstract                 = {Protein-protein interactions play crucial roles in the execution of various biological functions. Accordingly, their comprehensive description would contribute considerably to the functional interpretation of fully sequenced genomes, which are flooded with novel genes of unpredictable functions. We previously developed a system to examine two-hybrid interactions in all possible combinations between the approximately 6,000 proteins of the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Here we have completed the comprehensive analysis using this system to identify 4,549 two-hybrid interactions among 3,278 proteins. Unexpectedly, these data do not largely overlap with those obtained by the other project [Uetz, P., et al. (2000) Nature (London) 403, 623-627] and hence have substantially expanded our knowledge on the protein interaction space or interactome of the yeast. Cumulative connection of these binary interactions generates a single huge network linking the vast majority of the proteins. Bioinformatics-aided selection of biologically relevant interactions highlights various intriguing subnetworks. They include, for instance, the one that had successfully foreseen the involvement of a novel protein in spindle pole body function as well as the one that may uncover a hitherto unidentified multiprotein complex potentially participating in the process of vesicular transport. Our data would thus significantly expand and improve the protein interaction map for the exploration of genome functions that eventually leads to thorough understanding of the cell as a molecular system.},

  Abstract                 = {The best known genes of microbes, mice and men are those that specify enzymes. Wild type, mutant and heterozygote for variants of such genes differ in the catalytic activity at the step in the enzyme network specified by the gene in question. The effect on the respective phenotypes of such changes in catalytic activity, however, is not defined by the enzymes change as estimated by in vitro determination of the activities obtained from the extracts of the three groups. In vivo enzymes do not act in isolation, but are kinetically linked to other enzymes via their substrates and products. These interactions modify the effect of enzyme variation on the phenotype, depending on the nature and quantity of the other enzymes present. An output of such a system, say a flux, is therefore a systemic property, and its response to variation at one locus must be measured in the whole system. This response is best described by the sensitivity coefficient, Z, while is defined by the fractional change in flux over the fractional change in enzyme activity. (formula: see text). Its magnitude determines the extent to which a particular enzyme "controls" a particular flux or phenotype and, implicitly, determines the values that the three phenotypes will have. There are as many sensitivity coefficients for a given flux as there are enzymes in the system. It can be shown that the sum of all such coefficients equals unity. (formula: see text). Since n, the number of enzymes, is large, this summation property results in the individual coefficients being small. The effect of making a large change in enzyme activity therefore usually results in only a negligible change in flux. A reduction to 50\% activity in the heterozygote, a common feature for many mutants, is therefore not expected to be detectable in the phenotype. The mutant would therefore be described as "recessive". The widespread occurrence of recessive mutants is thus seen to be the inevitable consequence of the kinetic structure of enzyme networks. The ad hoc hypothesis of "modifiers" selected to maximize the fitness of the heterozygote, as proposed by Fisher, is therefore unnecessary. It is based on the false general expectation of an intermediate phenotype in the heterozygote. Wright's analysis, substantially sound in its approach, proposed selection of a "safety factor" in enzyme activity. The derivation of the summation property explains why such safety factors are automatically present in almost all enzymes without selection.},

With the availability of well-characterized components from natural gene networks, the stage has been set for the engineering of artificial gene regulatory networks with sophisticated computational and functional capabilities. In these efforts, the ability to construct, analyze, and interpret qualitative and quantitative models is becoming increasingly important. In this review, we consider the current state of gene network engineering from a combined experimental and modeling perspective. We discuss how networks with increased complexity are being constructed from simple modular components and how quantitative deterministic and stochastic modeling of these modules may provide the foundation for accurate in silico representations of gene regulatory network function in vivo.},

  Abstract                 = {Complex gene-regulation networks are made of simple recurring gene circuits called network motifs. The functions of several network motifs have recently been studied experimentally, including the coherent feed-forward loop (FFL) with an AND input function that acts as a sign-sensitive delay element. Here, we study the function of the coherent FFL with a sum input function (SUM-FFL). We analyze the dynamics of this motif by means of high-resolution expression measurements in the flagella gene-regulation network, the system that allows Escherichia coli to swim. In this system, the master regulator FlhDC activates a second regulator, FliA, and both activate in an additive fashion the operons that produce the flagella motor. We find that this motif prolongs flagella expression following deactivation of the master regulator, protecting flagella production from transient loss of input signal. Thus, in contrast to the AND-FFL that shows a delay following signal activation, the SUM-FFL shows delays after signal deactivation. The SUM-FFL in this system works as theoretically predicted despite being embedded in at least two additional feedback loops. The present function might be carried out by the SUM-FFL in systems found across organisms.},

EcoCyc assigns E. coli genes to Gene Ontology and to MultiFun. Seventy-five percent of gene products contain reviews authored by the EcoCyc project that summarize the experimental literature about the gene product. EcoCyc information was derived from 15 000 publications. The database contains extensive descriptions of E. coli cellular networks, describing its metabolic, transport and transcriptional regulatory processes. A comparison to genome annotations for other model organisms shows that the E. coli genome contains the most experimentally determined gene functions in both relative and absolute terms: 2941 (66\%) for E. coli, 2319 (37\%) for Saccharomyces cerevisiae, 1816 (5\%) for Arabidopsis thaliana, 1456 (4\%) for Mus musculus and 614 (4\%) for Drosophila melanogaster. Database queries to EcoCyc survey the global properties of E. coli cellular networks and illuminate the extent of information gaps for E. coli, such as dead-end metabolites. EcoCyc provides a genome browser with novel properties, and a novel interactive display of transcriptional regulatory networks.},

Closer examination, however, challenges the assumptions that (1) such distributions are special and (2) they signify a common architecture, independent of the system's specifics. The real surprise, if any, is that power-law distributions are easy to generate, and by a variety of mechanisms.

  Abstract                 = {The usual equations expressing the enzyme control coefficients (quantitative indicators of 'global' control properties of a pathway) via the elasticity coefficients (reflecting local kinetic properties of an enzyme reaction), cannot be applied to a variety of 'non-ideal' pathways, in particular to pathways with metabolic channelling. Here we show that the relationship between the control and elasticity coefficients can be obtained by considering such a metabolic pathway as a network of elemental chemical conversions (steps). To calculate the control coefficients of enzymes one should first determine the elasticity coefficients of such elemental steps and then take their appropriate combinations. Although the method is illustrated for a channelled pathway it can be used for any non-ideal pathway including those with high enzyme concentrations where the sequestration of metabolites by enzymes cannot be neglected.},

  Abstract                 = {Reactions for which the rates are extremely sensitive to changes in the concentrations of variable metabolite concentrations contribute little to the control of biochemical reaction networks. Yet they do interfere with the calculation of the system's behaviour, both in terms of numerical integration of the rate equations and in terms of the analysis of metabolic control. We here present a way to solve this problem systematically for systems with time hierarchies. We identify the fast reactions and fast metabolites, group them apart from the other ("slow") reactions and metabolites, and then apply the appropriate quasi-equilibrium condition for the fast subsystem. This then makes it possible to eliminate the fast reactions and their elasticity coefficients from the calculations, allowing the calculation of the control coefficients of the slow reactions in terms of the elasticity coefficients of the slow reactions. As expected, the elasticity coefficients of the fast reactions drop out of the calculations, and they are irrelevant for control at the time resolution of the steady state of the slow reactions. The analysis, when applied iteratively, is expected to be particularly valuable for the control analysis of living cells, where a time hierarchy exists, the fastest being at the level of enzyme kinetics and the slowest at gene expression.},

Efforts to accomplish this based on over-expression of the enzyme, catalyzing the so-called "rate-limiting step," have not been successful. Here we develop a method to determine the enzyme concentrations that are required to achieve such an aim. This method is called Metabolic Design Analysis and is based on the perturbation method and the modular ("top-down") approach-formalisms that were first developed for the analysis of biochemical regulation such as, Metabolic Control Analysis. Contrary to earlier methods, the desired alterations of cellular metabolism need not be small or confined to a single metabolite or flux. The limits to the alterations of fluxes and metabolite concentrations are identified. To employ Metabolic Design Analysis, only limited kinetic information concerning the pathway enzymes is needed.},

  Abstract                 = {With molecular genetics enabling modulation of the concentrations of cellular enzymes, metabolic engineering becomes limited by the question of which modulations of the enzyme concentrations are required to bring about a desired pattern of cellular metabolism. In an earlier paper (Kholodenko et al. (1998). Biotechnol. Bioeng. 59, 239-247) we derived a method to determine the required modulations. This method, however, cannot be immediately applied to cellular pathways with enzymes catalyzing more than one step in metabolism (multifunctional enzymes). In the present paper we show to which extent the presence of multifunctional enzymes limits biotechological ambitions, which one might otherwise pursue in vain. In particular, it is impossible to change the concentration of a single intermediate and leave the rest of metabolism unperturbed if that intermediate interacts directly with a multifunctional enzyme. The analytical machinery of Metabolic Control Analysis is used to relate the desired and ensuing changes in the metabolic pattern. An explicit solution to this problem of engineering metabolism is then given in the form of a single matrix equation.},

Here we show how the variability in copy number can be controlled by perturbing gene expression. Depending on the genetic network and host, different perturbations can be applied to control variability. To understand more fully how noise propagates and behaves in biochemical networks we developed stochastic control analysis (SCA) which is a sensitivity-based analysis framework for the study of noise control. Here we apply SCA to synthetic gene expression systems encoded on plasmids that are transformed into Escherichia coli. We show that (1) dual control of transcription and translation efficiencies provides the most efficient way of noise-versus-mean control. (2) The expressed proteins follow the gamma distribution function as found in chromosomal proteins. (3) One of the major sources of noise, leading to the cell-to-cell variability in protein copy numbers, is related to bursty translation. (4) By taking into account stochastic fluctuations in autofluorescence, the correct scaling relationship between the noise and mean levels of the protein copy numbers was recovered for the case of weak fluorescence signals.},

Although there has been significant progress in machine-readable representation of networks, as exemplified by the Systems Biology Mark-up Language (SBML) (http://www.sbml.org) issues in human-readable representation have been largely ignored. This article discusses human-readable diagrammatic representations and proposes a set of notations that enhances the formality and richness of the information represented. The process diagram is a fully state transition-based diagram that can be translated into machine-readable forms such as SBML in a straightforward way. It is supported by CellDesigner, a diagrammatic network editing software (http://www.celldesigner.org/), and has been used to represent a variety of networks of various sizes (from only a few components to several hundred components).},

  Abstract                 = {The concept of elementary (flux) modes provides a rigorous description of pathways in metabolic networks and proved to be valuable in a number of applications. However, the computation of elementary modes is a hard computational task that gave rise to several variants of algorithms during the last years. This work brings substantial progresses to this issue. The authors start with a brief review of results obtained from previous work regarding (a) a unified framework for elementary-mode computation, (b) network compression and redundancy removal and (c) the binary approach by which elementary modes are determined as binary patterns reducing the memory demand drastically without loss of speed. Then the authors will address herein further issues. First, a new way to perform the elementarity tests required during the computation of elementary modes which empirically improves significantly the computation time in large networks is proposed. Second, a method to compute only those elementary modes where certain reactions are involved is derived. Relying on this method, a promising approach for computing EMs in a completely distributed manner by decomposing the full problem in arbitrarity many sub-tasks is presented. The new methods have been implemented in the freely available software tools FluxAnalyzer and Metatool and benchmark tests in realistic networks emphasise the potential of our proposed algorithms.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: Mathematical modelling of cellular networks is an integral part of Systems Biology and requires appropriate software tools. An important class of methods in Systems Biology deals with structural or topological (parameter-free) analysis of cellular networks. So far, software tools providing such methods for both mass-flow (metabolic) as well as signal-flow (signalling and regulatory) networks are lacking. RESULTS: Herein we introduce CellNetAnalyzer, a toolbox for MATLAB facilitating, in an interactive and visual manner, a comprehensive structural analysis of metabolic, signalling and regulatory networks. The particular strengths of CellNetAnalyzer are methods for functional network analysis, i.e. for characterising functional states, for detecting functional dependencies, for identifying intervention strategies, or for giving qualitative predictions on the effects of perturbations. CellNetAnalyzer extends its predecessor FluxAnalyzer (originally developed for metabolic network and pathway analysis) by a new modelling framework for examining signal-flow networks. Two of the novel methods implemented in CellNetAnalyzer are discussed in more detail regarding algorithmic issues and applications: the computation and analysis (i) of shortest positive and shortest negative paths and circuits in interaction graphs and (ii) of minimal intervention sets in logical networks. CONCLUSION: CellNetAnalyzer provides a single suite to perform structural and qualitative analysis of both mass-flow- and signal-flow-based cellular networks in a user-friendly environment. It provides a large toolbox with various, partially unique, functions and algorithms for functional network analysis. CellNetAnalyzer is freely available for academic use.},

The method is based on the null-space matrix to the stoichiometry matrix corresponding to the reactions with unknown velocities. Moreover, an elementary representation of the null-space is presented. This representation enables one to find those sets of measurable velocities that allow calculation of a certain non-measurable rate.

However, in larger networks it is hampered by the combinatorial explosion of possible routes. In this work we give some estimations on the combinatorial complexity including theoretical upper bounds for the number of elementary flux modes in a network of a given size. In a case study, we computed the elementary modes in the central metabolism of Escherichia coli while utilizing four different substrates. Interestingly, although the number of modes occurring in this complex network can exceed half a million, it is still far below the upper bound. Hence, to a certain extent, pathway analysis of central catabolism is feasible to assess network properties such as flexibility and functionality.},

  Abstract                 = {Metabolic pathway analysis is becoming increasingly important for assessing inherent network properties in (reconstructed) biochemical reaction networks. Of the two most promising concepts for pathway analysis, one relies on elementary flux modes and the other on extreme pathways. These concepts are closely related because extreme pathways are a subset of elementary modes. Here, the common features, differences and applicability of these concepts are discussed. Assessing metabolic systems by the set of extreme pathways can, in general, give misleading results owing to the exclusion of possibly important routes. However, in certain network topologies, the sets of elementary modes and extreme pathways coincide. This is quite often the case in realistic applications. In our opinion, the unification of both approaches into one common framework for metabolic pathway analysis is necessary and achievable.},

Here, we show that the slow diffusion of the bulky tRNA complexes in the crowded cytoplasm imposes a physical limit on the speed of translation, which ultimately limits the rate of cell growth. To study the required allocation of ancillary translational proteins to alleviate the effect of molecular crowding, we develop a model for cell growth based on a coarse-grained partitioning of the proteome. We find that coregulation of ribosome- and tRNA-affiliated proteins is consistent with measured growth-rate dependencies and results in near-optimal allocation over a broad range of growth rates. The analysis further resolves a long-standing controversy in bacterial growth physiology concerning the growth-rate dependence of translation speed and serves as a caution against premature identification of phenomenological parameters with mechanistic processes.},

We distinguish different types of growth-rate dependencies by the mechanisms of regulation involved and the presence or absence of an effect of the gene product on growth. The latter can lead to growth feedback, feedback mediated by changes of the global state of the cell. Moreover, we discuss how growth rate dependence can be used as a guide to study the molecular implementation of physiological regulation.},

  abstract =             {The nature of the control of glycolytic flux is one of the central, as-yet-uncharacterized issues in cellular metabolism. We developed a molecular genetic tool that specifically induces ATP hydrolysis in living cells without interfering with other aspects of metabolism. Genes encoding the F1 part of the membrane-bound (F1F0) H+-ATP synthase were expressed in steadily growing Escherichia coli cells, which lowered the intracellular [ATP]/[ADP] ratio. This resulted in a strong stimulation of the specific glycolytic flux concomitant with a smaller decrease in the growth rate of the cells. By optimizing additional ATP hydrolysis, we increased the flux through glycolysis to 1.7 times that of the wild-type flux. The results demonstrate why attempts in the past to increase the glycolytic flux through overexpression of glycolytic enzymes have been unsuccessful: the majority of flux control (>75\%) resides not inside but outside the pathway, i.e., with the enzymes that hydrolyze ATP. These data further allowed us to answer the question of whether catabolic or anabolic reactions control the growth of E. coli. We show that the majority of the control of growth rate resides in the anabolic reactions, i.e., the cells are mostly "carbon" limited. Ways to increase the efficiency and productivity of industrial fermentation processes are discussed. 10.1128/JB.184.14.3909-3916.2002},

A diagram convention was designed capable of unambiguous representation of networks containing multiprotein complexes, protein modifications, and enzymes that are substrates of other enzymes. To facilitate linkage to a database, each molecular species is symbolically represented only once in each diagram. Molecular species can be located on the map by means of indexed grid coordinates. Each interaction is referenced to an annotation list where pertinent information and references can be found. Parts of the network are grouped into functional subsystems. The map shows how multiprotein complexes could assemble and function at gene promoter sites and at sites of DNA damage. It also portrays the richness of connections between the p53-Mdm2 subsystem and other parts of the network.},

  Abstract                 = {To help us understand how bioregulatory networks operate, we need a standard notation for diagrams analogous to electronic circuit diagrams. Such diagrams must surmount the difficulties posed by complex patterns of protein modifications and multiprotein complexes. To meet that challenge, we have designed the molecular interaction map (MIM) notation (http://discover.nci.nih.gov/mim/). Here we show the advantages of the MIM notation for three important types of diagrams: (1) explicit diagrams that define specific pathway models for computer simulation; (2) heuristic maps that organize the available information about molecular interactions and encompass the possible processes or pathways; and (3) diagrams of combinatorially complex models. We focus on signaling from the epidermal growth factor receptor family (EGFR, ErbB), a network that reflects the major challenges of representing in a compact manner the combinatorial complexity of multimolecular complexes. By comparing MIMs with other diagrams of this network that have recently been published, we show the utility of the MIM notation. These comparisons may help cell and systems biologists adopt a graphical language that is unambiguous and generally understood.},

  Abstract                 = {Fermentation kinetics of ethanol production from glucose, xylose, and their mixtures using a recombinant Saccharomyces 1400(pLNH33) are reported. Single-substrate kinetics indicate that the specific growth rate of the yeast and the specific ethanol productivity on glucose as the substrate was greater than on xylose as a substrate. Ethanol yields from glucose and xylose fermentation were typically 95 and 80\% of the theoretical yield, respectively. The effect of ethanol inhibition is more pronounced for xylose fermentation than for glucose fermentation. Studies on glucose-xylose mixtures indicate that the recombinant yeast co-ferments glucose and xylose. Fermentation of a 52.8 g/L glucose and 56.3 g/L xylose mixture gave an ethanol concentration of 47.9 g/L after 36 h. Based on a theoretical yield of 0.51 g ethanol/g sugars, the ethanol yield from this experiment (for data up to 24 h) was calculated to be 0.46 g ethanol/g sugar or 90\% of the theoretical yield. The specific growth rate of the yeast on glucose-xylose mixtures was found to lie between the specific growth rate on glucose and the specific growth rate on xylose. Kinetic studies were used to develop a fermentation model incorporating the effects of substrate inhibition, product inhibition, and inoculum size. Good agreements were obtained between model predictions and experimental data from batch fermentation of glucose, xylose, and their mixtures.},

Machine learning was used to integrate the mass spectrometry scores and assign probabilities to the protein-protein interactions. Among 4,087 different proteins identified with high confidence by mass spectrometry from 2,357 successful purifications, our core data set (median precision of 0.69) comprises 7,123 protein-protein interactions involving 2,708 proteins. A Markov clustering algorithm organized these interactions into 547 protein complexes averaging 4.9 subunits per complex, about half of them absent from the MIPS database, as well as 429 additional interactions between pairs of complexes. The data (all of which are available online) will help future studies on individual proteins as well as functional genomics and systems biology.},

  Abstract                 = {Biochemical network maps are helpful for understanding the mechanism of how a collection of biochemical reactions generate particular functions within a cell. We developed a new and computationally feasible notation that enables drawing a wide resolution map from the domain-level reactions to phenomenological events and implemented it as the extended GUI network constructor of CADLIVE (Computer-Aided Design of LIVing systEms). The new notation presents 'Domain expansion' for proteins and RNAs, 'Virtual reaction and nodes' that are responsible for illustrating domain-based interaction and 'InnerLink' that links real complex nodes to virtual nodes to illustrate the exact components of the real complex. A modular box is also presented that packs related reactions as a module or a subnetwork, which gives CADLIVE a capability to draw biochemical maps in a hierarchical modular architecture. Furthermore, we developed a pathway search module for virtual knockout mutants as a built-in application of CADLIVE. This module analyzes gene function in the same way as molecular genetics, which simulates a change in mutant phenotypes or confirms the validity of the network map. The extended CADLIVE with the newly proposed notation is demonstrated to be feasible for computational simulation and analysis.},

This paper is meant to serve as an initial guide for both the biologists interested in formal approaches and the mathematicians or computer scientists wishing to inject more realism into their models. The paper is focused on the structural aspects of metabolism only. The literature is vast enough already, and the thread through it difficult to follow even for the more experienced worker in the field. We explain methods for acquiring data and reconstructing metabolic networks, and review the various models that have been used for their structural analysis. Several concepts such as modularity are introduced, as are the controversies that have beset the field these past few years, for instance, on whether metabolic networks are small-world or scale-free, and on which model better explains the evolution of metabolism. Clarifying the work that has been done also helps in identifying open questions and in proposing relevant future directions in the field, which we do along the paper and in the conclusion.},

Fluorescent biosensors are able to determine the localization of proteins and their dynamics, to reveal the cellular and subcellular localization of the respective interactions and activities, and to provide complementary data on the steady state levels of ions, metabolites, and signaling intermediates with high temporal and spatial resolution.

  Abstract                 = {The interdependence of the activities of branch point enzymes which compete for a common substrate can yield ultrasensitivity or subsensitivity to control, even if the competing enzymes follow Michaelis-Menten kinetics. The nature of this "branch point effect" for a particular system depends on the kinetic parameters of the competing enzymes, the rate of substrate production leading into the branch point and the type of regulatory mechanism involved. With physiologically reasonable parameter values, the branch point effect can give ultrasensitivity equivalent to an allosteric enzyme with a Hill coefficient of 8 or higher. An experimental example of this ultrasensitivity was provided by the branch point between isocitrate lyase (of the glyoxylate bypass) and isocitrate dehydrogenase in Escherichia coli. The glyoxylate bypass is very active during growth on acetate but its flux decreases by a factor of approximately 150 upon addition of glucose. This inhibition is brought about by two relatively modest events: a 4-fold increase in the maximum velocity of isocitrate dehydrogenase and a factor of 5.5 decrease in the rate of isocitrate production. The mechanism which underlies this sensitivity amplification is discussed.},

However, stimulated by advances in imaging technologies, single-cell studies have become an essential tool in understanding the rules that govern gene expression. This quantitative view of single-cell gene expression is based on counting mRNAs in single cells, monitoring transcription in real time, and visualizing single proteins. Parallel advances in mathematical models based on stochastic, discrete descriptions of biochemical processes have provided crucial insights into the underlying cellular mechanisms that control expression. The view that has emerged is rooted in a probabilistic understanding of cellular processes that quantitatively explains both the mean and the variation observed in gene-expression patterns among single cells. Thus, the close coupling between imaging and mathematical theory has established single-cell analysis as an essential branch of systems biology.},

  Abstract                 = {The intracellular activity of the p53 tumor suppressor protein is regulated through a feedback loop involving its transcriptional target, mdm2. We present a simple mathematical model suggesting that, under certain circumstances, oscillations in p53 and Mdm2 protein levels can emerge in response to a stress signal. A delay in p53-dependent induction of Mdm2 is predicted to be required, albeit not sufficient, for this oscillatory behavior. In line with the predictions of the model, oscillations of both p53 and Mdm2 indeed occur on exposure of various cell types to ionizing radiation. Such oscillations may allow cells to repair their DNA without risking the irreversible consequences of continuous excessive p53 activation.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: Translating a known metabolic network into a dynamic model requires reasonable guesses of all enzyme parameters. In Bayesian parameter estimation, model parameters are described by a posterior probability distribution, which scores the potential parameter sets, showing how well each of them agrees with the data and with the prior assumptions made. RESULTS: We compute posterior distributions of kinetic parameters within a Bayesian framework, based on integration of kinetic, thermodynamic, metabolic, and proteomic data. The structure of the metabolic system (i.e., stoichiometries and enzyme regulation) needs to be known, and the reactions are modelled by convenience kinetics with thermodynamically independent parameters. The parameter posterior is computed in two separate steps: a first posterior summarises the available data on enzyme kinetic parameters; an improved second posterior is obtained by integrating metabolic fluxes, concentrations, and enzyme concentrations for one or more steady states. The data can be heterogeneous, incomplete, and uncertain, and the posterior is approximated by a multivariate log-normal distribution. We apply the method to a model of the threonine synthesis pathway: the integration of metabolic data has little effect on the marginal posterior distributions of individual model parameters. Nevertheless, it leads to strong correlations between the parameters in the joint posterior distribution, which greatly improve the model predictions by the following Monte-Carlo simulations. CONCLUSION: We present a standardised method to translate metabolic networks into dynamic models. To determine the model parameters, evidence from various experimental data is combined and weighted using Bayesian parameter estimation. The resulting posterior parameter distribution describes a statistical ensemble of parameter sets; the parameter variances and correlations can account for missing knowledge, measurement uncertainties, or biological variability. The posterior distribution can be used to sample model instances and to obtain probabilistic statements about the model's dynamic behaviour.},

  Abstract                 = {We present an all-atom molecular modeling method that can predict the binding specificity of a transcription factor based on its 3D structure, with no further information required. We use molecular dynamics and free energy calculations to compute the relative binding free energies for a transcription factor with multiple possible DNA sequences. These sequences are then used to construct a position weight matrix to represent the transcription factor-binding sites. Free energy differences are calculated by morphing one base pair into another using a multi-copy representation in which multiple base pairs are superimposed at a single DNA position. Water-mediated hydrogen bonds between transcription factor side chains and DNA bases are known to contribute to binding specificity for certain transcription factors. To account for this important effect, the simulation protocol includes an explicit molecular water solvent and counter-ions. For computational efficiency, we use a standard additive approximation for the contribution of each DNA base pair to the total binding free energy. The additive approximation is not strictly necessary, and more detailed computations could be used to investigate non-additive effects.},

  Abstract                 = {There are several methodologies based on representations of cell metabolism that share two characteristics: the use of a metabolic network and the assumption of pseudosteady state. These methodologies have different purposes, employ different mathematical tools and are based on different assumptions; however, they all exploit the properties of a similar mathematical description. In this article we use the term stoichiometric modelling to encompass all these methodologies and to describe them within a common framework. Although the information about reaction stoichiometry embedded in metabolic networks is highly important, the framework encompasses methodologies not limited to the use of stoichiometric information. To highlight this fact, the definition of the framework is approached from a constraint-based perspective. One of the reasons for the success of stoichiometric modelling is that it avoids the difficulties that arise in the development of kinetic models: a consequence of the lack of intracellular experimental measurements. Thus, it makes it possible to exploit the knowledge about the structure of cell metabolism, without considering the still not very well known intracellular kinetic processes. Stoichiometric models have been used to estimate the metabolic flux distribution under given circumstances in the cell at some given moment (metabolic flux analysis), to predict it on the basis of some optimality hypothesis (flux balance analysis), and as tools for the structural analysis of metabolism providing information about systemic characteristics of the cell under investigation (network-based pathway analysis).},

The number of protein complexes and of chemical interactions among them has traditionally posed significant problems for simulation algorithms. Here we describe an approach to the exact stochastic simulation of biochemical networks that emphasizes the contribution of protein complexes to these systems. This simulation approach starts from a description of monomeric proteins and specifications for binding, unbinding and other reactions. This manageable specification is reasonably intuitive for biologists. Rather than requiring the inclusion of all possible complexes and reactions from the outset, our approach incorporates new complexes and reactions only when needed as the simulation proceeds. As a result, the simulation generates much smaller reaction networks, which can be exported to other simulators for further analysis. We apply this approach to the automatic generation of reaction systems for the study of signal transduction networks.},

SUNDIALS' CVODES is incorporated for numerical integration and sensitivity analysis. Preliminary benchmarking results give a rough overview on the behavior of different tools and are discussed in the Supplementary Material. The native application program interface provides fine-grained interfaces to all internal data structures, symbolic operations and numerical routines, enabling the construction of very efficient analytic applications and hybrid or multi-scale solvers with interfaces to SBML and non SBML data sources. Optional modules based on XMGrace and Graphviz allow quick inspection of structure and dynamics.},

  Abstract                 = {Complex gene regulation networks are made of simple recurring gene circuits called network motifs. One of the most common network motifs is the incoherent type-1 feed-forward loop (I1-FFL), in which a transcription activator activates a gene directly, and also activates a repressor of the gene. Mathematical modeling suggested that the I1-FFL can show two dynamical features: a transient pulse of gene expression, and acceleration of the dynamics of the target gene. It is important to experimentally study the dynamics of this motif in living cells, to test whether it carries out these functions even when embedded within additional interactions in the cell. Here, we address this using a system with incoherent feed-forward loop connectivity, the galactose (gal) system of Escherichia coli. We measured the dynamics of this system in response to inducing signals at high temporal resolution and accuracy by means of green fluorescent protein reporters. We show that the galactose system displays accelerated turn-on dynamics. The acceleration is abolished in strains and conditions that disrupt the I1-FFL. The I1-FFL motif in the gal system works as theoretically predicted despite being embedded in several additional feedback loops. Response acceleration may be performed by the incoherent feed-forward loop modules that are found in diverse systems from bacteria to humans.},

  Abstract                 = {Recent analysis of the structure of transcription regulation networks revealed several "network motifs": regulatory circuit patterns that occur much more frequently than in randomized networks. It is important to understand whether these network motifs have specific functions. One of the most significant network motifs is the coherent feedforward loop, in which transcription factor X regulates transcription factor Y, and both jointly regulate gene Z. On the basis of mathematical modeling and simulations, it was suggested that the coherent feedforward loop could serve as a sign-sensitive delay element: a circuit that responds rapidly to step-like stimuli in one direction (e.g. ON to OFF), and at a delay to steps in the opposite direction (OFF to ON). Is this function actually carried out by feedforward loops in living cells? Here, we address this experimentally, using a system with feedforward loop connectivity, the L-arabinose utilization system of Escherichia coli. We measured responses to step-like cAMP stimuli at high temporal resolution and accuracy by means of green fluorescent protein reporters. We show that the arabinose system displays sign-sensitive delay kinetics. This type of kinetics is important for making decisions based on noisy inputs by filtering out fluctuations in input stimuli, yet allowing rapid response. This information-processing function may be performed by the feedforward loop regulation modules that are found in diverse systems from bacteria to humans.},

  Abstract                 = {Engineered systems are often built of recurring circuit modules that carry out key functions. Transcription networks that regulate the responses of living cells were recently found to obey similar principles: they contain several biochemical wiring patterns, termed network motifs, which recur throughout the network. One of these motifs is the feed-forward loop (FFL). The FFL, a three-gene pattern, is composed of two input transcription factors, one of which regulates the other, both jointly regulating a target gene. The FFL has eight possible structural types, because each of the three interactions in the FFL can be activating or repressing. Here, we theoretically analyze the functions of these eight structural types. We find that four of the FFL types, termed incoherent FFLs, act as sign-sensitive accelerators: they speed up the response time of the target gene expression following stimulus steps in one direction (e.g., off to on) but not in the other direction (on to off). The other four types, coherent FFLs, act as sign-sensitive delays. We find that some FFL types appear in transcription network databases much more frequently than others. In some cases, the rare FFL types have reduced functionality (responding to only one of their two input stimuli), which may partially explain why they are selected against. Additional features, such as pulse generation and cooperativity, are discussed. This study defines the function of one of the most significant recurring circuit elements in transcription networks.},

The Gillespie stochastic simulation algorithm is used in all tests. With all the tools, we are able to simulate stochastically the behavior of the selected test case and to produce similar results as our own MATLABreg implementation. However, it is not possible to use time-dependent inputs in stochastic simulations in Systems Biology Toolbox and Copasi.

The calculations are performed by using detailed rate laws that have been derived for the enzymes of Escherichia coli. Due to linear relationships between the metabolite concentrations, the numerical solutions can be displayed inside a trapezium, so that the concentrations of four different metabolites are indicated along the trapezium edges. The analysis reveals a rich variety of time patterns, corresponding to different periodic, quasiperiodic, and chaotic attractors. These patterns undergo complex hysteresis loops when bifurcation parameters are slowly changed-for example, by modulating the input amplitude. By using this technique up to four attractors coexisting in phase space are found. The time patterns corresponding to coexisting attractors can be switched into one another by triggering the system with short substrate pulses. Furthermore, conditions exist at which the triggering is autonomous-i.e., self-sustained (intermittent) switchings occur. The time between these switchings can be set externally by the value of the input amplitude. For conditions in which the periods of the oscillations are in the order of minutes, the self-sustained switching-which modulates these oscillations-can be in the order of hours.},

  Abstract                 = {A key to advancing the understanding of molecular biology in the post-genomic age is the development of accurate predictive models for genetic regulation, protein interaction, metabolism, and other biochemical processes. To facilitate model development, simulation algorithms must provide an accurate representation of the system, while performing the simulation in a reasonable amount of time. Gillespie's stochastic simulation algorithm (SSA) accurately depicts spatially homogeneous models with small populations of chemical species and properly represents noise, but it is often abandoned when modeling larger systems because of its computational complexity. In this work, we examine the performance of different versions of the SSA when applied to several biochemical models. Through our analysis, we discover that transient changes in reaction execution frequencies, which are typical of biochemical models with gene induction and repression, can dramatically affect simulator performance. To account for these shifts, we propose a new algorithm called the sorting direct method that maintains a loosely sorted order of the reactions as the simulation executes. Our measurements show that the sorting direct method performs favorably when compared to other well-known exact stochastic simulation algorithms.},

  Abstract                 = {Fluctuations in protein numbers (noise) due to inherent stochastic effects in single cells can have large effects on the dynamic behavior of gene regulatory networks. Although deterministic models can predict the average network behavior, they fail to incorporate the stochasticity characteristic of gene expression, thereby limiting their relevance when single cell behaviors deviate from the population average. Recently, stochastic models have been used to predict distributions of steady-state protein levels within a population but not to predict the dynamic, presteady-state distributions. In the present work, we experimentally examine a system whose dynamics are heavily influenced by stochastic effects. We measure population distributions of protein numbers as a function of time in the Escherichia coli lactose uptake network (lac operon). We then introduce a dynamic stochastic model and show that prediction of dynamic distributions requires only a few noise parameters in addition to the rates that characterize a deterministic model. Whereas the deterministic model cannot fully capture the observed behavior, our stochastic model correctly predicts the experimental dynamics without any fit parameters. Our results provide a proof of principle for the possibility of faithfully predicting dynamic population distributions from deterministic models supplemented by a stochastic component that captures the major noise sources.},

Meyer uses a fresh approach to introduce a variety of problems and examples ranging from the elementary to the challenging and from simple applications to discovery problems. The focus on applications is a big difference between this book and others. Meyer's book is more rigorous and goes into more depth than some. He includes some of the more contemporary topics of applied linear algebra which are not normally found in undergraduate textbooks. Modern concepts and notation are used to introduce the various aspects of linear equations, leading readers easily to numerical computations and applications. The theoretical developments are always accompanied with examples, which are worked out in detail. Each section ends with a large number of carefully chosen exercises from which the students can gain further insight. The textbook contains more than 240 examples, 650 exercises, historical notes, and comments on numerical performance and some of the possible pitfalls of algorithms. It comes with a solutions manual that includes complete solutions to all of the exercises. As a bonus, a CD-ROM is included that contains a searchable copy of the entire textbook and all solutions. Detailed information on topics mentioned in examples, references for additional study, thumbnail sketches and photographs of mathematicians, and a history of linear algebra and computing are also on the CD-ROM, which can be used on all platforms. Students will love the book's clear presentation and informal writing style. The detailed applications are valuable to them in seeing how linear algebra is applied to real-life situations. One of the most interesting aspects of this book, however, is the inclusion of historical information. These personal insights into some of the greatest mathematicians who developed this subject provide a spark for students and make the teaching of this topic more fun.}},

The lack of a standard description format, lack of stringent reviewing and authors' carelessness are the main causes for incomplete model descriptions. With today's increased interest in detailed biochemical models, it is necessary to define a minimum quality standard for the encoding of those models. We propose a set of rules for curating quantitative models of biological systems. These rules define procedures for encoding and annotating models represented in machine-readable form. We believe their application will enable users to (i) have confidence that curated models are an accurate reflection of their associated reference descriptions, (ii) search collections of curated models with precision, (iii) quickly identify the biological phenomena that a given curated model or model constituent represents and (iv) facilitate model reuse and composition into large subcellular models.},

  Abstract                 = {Here we address the problem of parameter estimation (inverse problem) of nonlinear dynamic biochemical pathways. This problem is stated as a nonlinear programming (NLP) problem subject to nonlinear differential-algebraic constraints. These problems are known to be frequently ill-conditioned and multimodal. Thus, traditional (gradient-based) local optimization methods fail to arrive at satisfactory solutions. To surmount this limitation, the use of several state-of-the-art deterministic and stochastic global optimization methods is explored. A case study considering the estimation of 36 parameters of a nonlinear biochemical dynamic model is taken as a benchmark. Only a certain type of stochastic algorithm, evolution strategies (ES), is able to solve this problem successfully. Although these stochastic methods cannot guarantee global optimality with certainty, their robustness, plus the fact that in inverse problems they have a known lower bound for the cost function, make them the best available candidates.},

  Abstract                 = {The understanding of the control of metabolic flux in plants requires integrated mathematical formulations of gene and protein expression, enzyme kinetics, and developmental biology. Plants have a large number of metabolically active compartments, and non-steady-state conditions are frequently encountered. Consequently steady-state metabolic flux balance and isotopic flux balance modeling approaches have limited utility in probing plant metabolic systems. Transient isotopic flux analysis and kinetic modeling are powerful proven techniques for the quantification of metabolic fluxes in compartmentalized, dynamic metabolic systems. These tools are now widely used to address metabolic flux responses to environmental and genetic perturbations in plant metabolism. Continued developments in isotopic and kinetic modeling, quantifying metabolite exchange between compartments, and transcriptional and posttranscriptional regulatory mechanisms governing enzyme level and activity will enable simulation of large sections of plant metabolism under non-steady-state conditions. Metabolic control analysis will continue to make substantial contributions to the understanding of quantitative distribution of control of flux. From the synergy between mathematical models and experiments, creative methods for controlling the distribution of flux by genetic or environmental means will be discovered and rationally implemented.},

  Abstract                 = {We used a newly developed stochastic-based program to predict the fluctuations in numbers of molecules in a chemotactic signalling pathway of coliform bacteria. Specifically, we examined temporal changes in molecules of CheYp, a cytoplasmic protein known to influence the direction of rotation of the flagellar motor. Signalling molecules in the vicinity of a flagellar motor were represented as individual software objects interacting according to probabilities derived from experimentally-observed concentrations rate constants. The simulated CheYp molecules were found to undergo random fluctuations in number about an average corresponding to the deterministically calculated concentration. Both the relative amplitude of the fluctuations, as a proportion of the total number of molecules, and their average duration, increased as the simulated volume was reduced. In a simulation corresponding to 10\% of the volume of a bacterium, the average duration of fluctuations was found to be 80.7 ms, which is much shorter than the observed alternations between clockwise and counter clockwise rotations of tethered bacteria (typically 2.6 s). Our results are therefore not in agreement with a simple threshold-crossing model for motor switching. However, it is possible to filter the CheYp fluctuations to produce temporal distributions closer to the observed swimming behaviour and we discuss the possible implications for the control of motor rotation.},

  Abstract                 = {We propose and study a set of algorithms for discovering community structure in networks-natural divisions of network nodes into densely connected subgroups. Our algorithms all share two definitive features: first, they involve iterative removal of edges from the network to split it into communities, the edges removed being identified using any one of a number of possible "betweenness" measures, and second, these measures are, crucially, recalculated after each removal. We also propose a measure for the strength of the community structure found by our algorithms, which gives us an objective metric for choosing the number of communities into which a network should be divided. We demonstrate that our algorithms are highly effective at discovering community structure in both computer-generated and real-world network data, and show how they can be used to shed light on the sometimes dauntingly complex structure of networked systems.},

  Abstract                 = {Recognition of pathogen-associated molecular signatures is critically important in proper activation of the immune system. The toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling network is responsible for innate immune response. In mammalians, there are 11 TLRs that recognize a variety of ligands from pathogens to trigger immunological responses. In this paper, we present a comprehensive map of TLRs and interleukin 1 receptor signaling networks based on papers published so far. The map illustrates the possible existence of a main network subsystem that has a bow-tie structure in which myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88 (MyD88) is a nonredundant core element, two collateral subsystems with small GTPase and phosphatidylinositol signaling, and MyD88-independent pathway. There is extensive crosstalk between the main bow-tie network and subsystems, as well as feedback and feedforward controls. One obvious feature of this network is the fragility against removal of the nonredundant core element, which is MyD88, and involvement of collateral subsystems for generating different reactions and gene expressions for different stimuli.},

  Abstract                 = {Multistability, the capacity to achieve multiple internal states in response to a single set of external inputs, is the defining characteristic of a switch. Biological switches are essential for the determination of cell fate in multicellular organisms, the regulation of cell-cycle oscillations during mitosis and the maintenance of epigenetic traits in microbes. The multistability of several natural and synthetic systems has been attributed to positive feedback loops in their regulatory networks. However, feedback alone does not guarantee multistability. The phase diagram of a multistable system, a concise description of internal states as key parameters are varied, reveals the conditions required to produce a functional switch. Here we present the phase diagram of the bistable lactose utilization network of Escherichia coli. We use this phase diagram, coupled with a mathematical model of the network, to quantitatively investigate processes such as sugar uptake and transcriptional regulation in vivo. We then show how the hysteretic response of the wild-type system can be converted to an ultrasensitive graded response. The phase diagram thus serves as a sensitive probe of molecular interactions and as a powerful tool for rational network design.},

These pathway definitions insist on the balanced use of a whole network of biochemical reactions. Two such related definitions, elementary modes and extreme pathways, have generated novel hypotheses regarding biochemical network function. The relationship between these two approaches can be illustrated by comparing and contrasting the elementary modes and extreme pathways of previously published metabolic reconstructions of the human red blood cell (RBC) and the human pathogen Helicobacter pylori. Descriptions of network properties generated by using these two approaches in the analysis of realistic metabolic networks need careful interpretation.},

  Abstract                 = {Flux balance analysis (FBA) has emerged as an effective means to analyse biological networks in a quantitative manner. Much progress has been made on the extension of FBA to incorporate a priori biological knowledge, provide more practical descriptions of observed cell behaviours, and predict the outcome of network perturbations. Metabolomics is independently advancing as a set of high-throughput data acquisition tools providing dynamic profiles of metabolites in an unbiased manner. These data sets are neither yet sufficiently comprehensive nor accurate enough for generating large-scale kinetic models. Thus, there is a pressing need to develop quantitative techniques that can make use of the emerging data and embrace the associated uncertainties.

  Abstract                 = {Many regulatory molecules are present in low copy numbers per cell so that significant random fluctuations emerge spontaneously. Because cell viability depends on precise regulation of key events, such signal noise has been thought to impose a threat that cells must carefully eliminate. However, the precision of control is also greatly affected by the regulatory mechanisms' capacity for sensitivity amplification. Here we show that even if signal noise reduces the capacity for sensitivity amplification of threshold mechanisms, the effect on realistic regulatory kinetics can be the opposite: stochastic focusing (SF). SF particularly exploits tails of probability distributions and can be formulated as conventional multistep sensitivity amplification where signal noise provides the degrees of freedom. When signal fluctuations are sufficiently rapid, effects of time correlations in signal-dependent rates are negligible and SF works just like conventional sensitivity amplification. This means that, quite counterintuitively, signal noise can reduce the uncertainty in regulated processes. SF is exemplified by standard hyperbolic inhibition, and all probability distributions for signal noise are first derived from underlying chemical master equations. The negative binomial is suggested as a paradigmatic distribution for intracellular kinetics, applicable to stochastic gene expression as well as simple systems with Michaelis-Menten degradation or positive feedback. SF resembles stochastic resonance in that noise facilitates signal detection in nonlinear systems, but stochastic resonance is related to how noise in threshold systems allows for detection of subthreshold signals and SF describes how fluctuations can make a gradual response mechanism work more like a threshold mechanism.},

  Abstract                 = {The C(3)-C(4) metabolite interconversion at the anaplerotic node in many microorganisms involves a complex set of reactions. C(3) carboxylation to oxaloacetate can originate from phosphoenolpyruvate and pyruvate, and at the same time multiple C(4)-decarboxylating enzymes may be present. The functions of such parallel reactions are not yet fully understood. Using a (13)C NMR-based strategy, we here quantify the individual fluxes at the anaplerotic node of Corynebacterium glutamicum, which is an example of a bacterium possessing multiple carboxylation and decarboxylation reactions. C. glutamicum was grown with a (13)C-labeled glucose isotopomer mixture as the main carbon source and (13)C-labeled lactate as a cosubstrate. 58 isotopomers as well as 15 positional labels of biomass compounds were quantified. Applying a generally applicable mathematical model to include metabolite mass and carbon labeling balances, it is shown that pyruvate carboxylase contributed 91 +/- 7\% to C(3) carboxylation. The total in vivo carboxylation rate of 1.28 +/- 0.14 mmol/g dry weight/h exceeds the demand of carboxylated metabolites for biosyntheses 3-fold. Excess oxaloacetate was recycled to phosphoenolpyruvate by phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase. This shows that the reactions at the anaplerotic node might serve additional purposes other than only providing C(4) metabolites for biosynthesis.},

  Abstract                 = {It has long been hypothesised that futile cycles in cellular metabolism are involved in the regulation of biochemical pathways. Following the work of Newsholme and Crabtree, a quantitative theory was developed for this idea based on open-system thermodynamics and metabolic control analysis. It is shown that the stoichiometric sensitivity of an intermediary metabolite concentration with respect to changes in steady-state flux is governed by the effective equilibrium constant of the intermediate formation, and the equilibrium can be regulated by a futile cycle. The direction of the shift in the effective equilibrium constant depends on the direction of operation of the futile cycle. High stoichiometric sensitivity corresponds to ultrasensitivity of an intermediate concentration to net flow through a pathway; low stoichiometric sensitivity corresponds to super-robustness of concentration with respect to changes in flux. Both cases potentially play important roles in metabolic regulation. Futile cycles actively shift the effective equilibrium by expending energy; the magnitude of changes in effective equilibria and sensitivities is a function of the amount of energy used by a futile cycle. This proposed mechanism for control by futile cycles works remarkably similar to kinetic proofreading in biosynthesis. The sensitivity of the system is also intimately related to the rate of concentration fluctuations of intermediate metabolites. The possibility of different roles for the two major mechanisms within cellular biochemical regulation, namely reversible chemical modifications via futile cycles and shifting equilibrium by macromolecular binding, are discussed.},

  Abstract                 = {Mycobacterium tuberculosis is the focus of several investigations for design of newer drugs, as tuberculosis remains a major epidemic despite the availability of several drugs and a vaccine. Mycobacteria owe many of their unique qualities to mycolic acids, which are known to be important for their growth, survival, and pathogenicity. Mycolic acid biosynthesis has therefore been the focus of a number of biochemical and genetic studies. It also turns out to be the pathway inhibited by front-line anti-tubercular drugs such as isoniazid and ethionamide. Recent years have seen the emergence of systems-based methodologies that can be used to study microbial metabolism. Here, we seek to apply insights from flux balance analyses of the mycolic acid pathway (MAP) for the identification of anti-tubercular drug targets. We present a comprehensive model of mycolic acid synthesis in the pathogen M. tuberculosis involving 197 metabolites participating in 219 reactions catalysed by 28 proteins. Flux balance analysis (FBA) has been performed on the MAP model, which has provided insights into the metabolic capabilities of the pathway. In silico systematic gene deletions and inhibition of InhA by isoniazid, studied here, provide clues about proteins essential for the pathway and hence lead to a rational identification of possible drug targets. Feasibility studies using sequence analysis of the M. tuberculosis H37Rv and human proteomes indicate that, apart from the known InhA, potential targets for anti-tubercular drug design are AccD3, Fas, FabH, Pks13, DesA1/2, and DesA3. Proteins identified as essential by FBA correlate well with those previously identified experimentally through transposon site hybridisation mutagenesis. This study demonstrates the application of FBA for rational identification of potential anti-tubercular drug targets, which can indeed be a general strategy in drug design. The targets, chosen based on the critical points in the pathway, form a ready shortlist for experimental testing.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: Metabolic fluxes provide invaluable insight on the integrated response of a cell to environmental stimuli or genetic modifications. Current computational methods for estimating the metabolic fluxes from 13C isotopomer measurement data rely either on manual derivation of analytic equations constraining the fluxes or on the numerical solution of a highly nonlinear system of isotopomer balance equations. In the first approach, analytic equations have to be tediously derived for each organism, substrate or labelling pattern, while in the second approach, the global nature of an optimum solution is difficult to prove and comprehensive measurements of external fluxes to augment the 13C isotopomer data are typically needed. RESULTS: We present a novel analytic framework for estimating metabolic flux ratios in the cell from 13C isotopomer measurement data. In the presented framework, equation systems constraining the fluxes are derived automatically from the model of the metabolism of an organism. The framework is designed to be applicable with all metabolic network topologies, 13C isotopomer measurement techniques, substrates and substrate labelling patterns.By analyzing nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and mass spectrometry (MS) measurement data obtained from the experiments on glucose with the model micro-organisms Bacillus subtilis and Saccharomyces cerevisiae we show that our framework is able to automatically produce the flux ratios discovered so far by the domain experts with tedious manual analysis. Furthermore, we show by in silico calculability analysis that our framework can rapidly produce flux ratio equations--as well as predict when the flux ratios are unobtainable by linear means--also for substrates not related to glucose. CONCLUSION: The core of 13C metabolic flux analysis framework introduced in this article constitutes of flow and independence analysis of metabolic fragments and techniques for manipulating isotopomer measurements with vector space techniques. These methods facilitate efficient, analytic computation of the ratios between the fluxes of pathways that converge to a common junction metabolite. The framework can been seen as a generalization and formalization of existing tradition for computing metabolic flux ratios where equations constraining flux ratios are manually derived, usually without explicitly showing the formal proofs of the validity of the equations.},

The principal analytical methods for the detection of stable isotopes are also described, as well as the procedures for obtaining flux maps from labeling data.

The computational problem in most cases exceeds the capability of available software tools, often resulting in inaccurate computation of the number and form of conserved cycles. Such errors have profound effects on subsequent calculations, particularly in the evaluation of the Jacobian which is a critical quantity in many other calculations. The goal of this paper is to outline a new algorithm that is computationally efficient and robust at extracting the correct conservation laws for very large biochemical networks. RESULTS: We show that our algorithm can perform the conservation analysis of large biochemical networks, and can evaluate the correct conserved cycles when compared with other similar software tools. Biochemical simulators such as Jarnac and COPASI are successful at extracting only a subset of the conservation laws that our algorithm can. This is illustrated with examples for some large networks which show the advantages of our method.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: Diverse datasets, including genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic and metabolomic data, are becoming readily available for specific organisms. There is currently a need to integrate these datasets within an in silico modeling framework. Constraint-based models of Escherichia coli K-12 MG1655 have been developed and used to study the bacterium's metabolism and phenotypic behavior. The most comprehensive E. coli model to date (E. coli iJE660a GSM) accounts for 660 genes and includes 627 unique biochemical reactions. RESULTS: An expanded genome-scale metabolic model of E. coli (iJR904 GSM/GPR) has been reconstructed which includes 904 genes and 931 unique biochemical reactions. The reactions in the expanded model are both elementally and charge balanced. Network gap analysis led to putative assignments for 55 open reading frames (ORFs). Gene to protein to reaction associations (GPR) are now directly included in the model. Comparisons between predictions made by iJR904 and iJE660a models show that they are generally similar but differ under certain circumstances. Analysis of genome-scale proton balancing shows how the flux of protons into and out of the medium is important for maximizing cellular growth. CONCLUSIONS: E. coli iJR904 has improved capabilities over iJE660a. iJR904 is a more complete and chemically accurate description of E. coli metabolism than iJE660a. Perhaps most importantly, iJR904 can be used for analyzing and integrating the diverse datasets. iJR904 will help to outline the genotype-phenotype relationship for E. coli K-12, as it can account for genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic and fluxomic data simultaneously.},

  Abstract                 = {It has hitherto not been possible to analyze the control of oscillatory dynamic cellular processes in other than qualitative ways. The control coefficients, used in metabolic control analyses of steady states, cannot be applied directly to dynamic systems. We here illustrate a way out of this limitation that uses Fourier transforms to convert the time domain into the stationary frequency domain, and then analyses the control of limit cycle oscillations. In addition to the already known summation theorems for frequency and amplitude, we reveal summation theorems that apply to the control of average value, waveform, and phase differences of the oscillations. The approach is made fully operational in an analysis of yeast glycolytic oscillations. It follows an experimental approach, sampling from the model output and using discrete Fourier transforms of this data set. It quantifies the control of various aspects of the oscillations by the external glucose concentration and by various internal molecular processes. We show that the control of various oscillatory properties is distributed over the system enzymes in ways that differ among those properties.

A combination of location and expression profiles was used to identify genes whose expression is directly controlled by Gal4 and Ste12 as cells respond to changes in carbon source and mating pheromone, respectively. The results identify pathways that are coordinately regulated by each of the two activators and reveal previously unknown functions for Gal4 and Ste12. Genome-wide location analysis will facilitate investigation of gene regulatory networks, gene function, and genome maintenance.},

At 5-s intervals cells were quenched in -40 degrees C methanol, extracted and the intracellular concentrations of glycolytic metabolites, adenine nucleotides and phosphate were analysed. Oscillations were found for the glycolytic intermediates glucose 6-phosphate, fructose 6-phosphate and fructose 1,6-bisphosphate. At variance with earlier reports on transient glycolytic oscillations, some intermediates further down the glycolytic pathway did not oscillate significantly, even though NADH did. In addition, the adenylate energy charge and the free energy of ATP hydrolysis oscillated significantly. Dynamic coupling through the latter may be responsible for this effective compartmentation of glycolytic dynamics.},

  Abstract                 = {To support their sessile and autotrophic lifestyle higher plants have evolved elaborate networks of metabolic pathways. Dynamic changes in these metabolic networks are among the developmental forces underlying the functional differentiation of organs, tissues and specialized cell types. They are also important in the various interactions of a plant with its environment. Further complexity is added by the extensive compartmentation of the various interconnected metabolic pathways in plants. Thus, although being used widely for assessing the control of metabolic flux in microbes, mathematical modeling approaches that require steady-state approximations are of limited utility for understanding complex plant metabolic networks. However, considerable progress has been made when manageable metabolic subsystems were studied. In this article, we will explain in general terms and using simple examples the concepts underlying stoichiometric modeling (metabolic flux analysis and metabolic pathway analysis) and kinetic approaches to modeling (including metabolic control analysis as a special case). Selected studies demonstrating the prospects of these approaches, or combinations of them, for understanding the control of flux through particular plant pathways are discussed. We argue that iterative cycles of (dry) mathematical modeling and (wet) laboratory testing will become increasingly important for simulating the distribution of flux in plant metabolic networks and deriving rational experimental designs for metabolic engineering efforts.},

  Abstract                 = {We present the framework of generalised supply-demand analysis (SDA) of a kinetic model of a cellular system, which can be applied to networks of arbitrary complexity. By fixing the concentrations of each of the variable species in turn and varying them in a parameter scan, rate characteristics of supply-demand are constructed around each of these species. By inspecting the shapes of the rate characteristic patterns and comparing the flux-response coefficients of the supply and demand blocks with the elasticities of the enzymes that interact directly with the fixed metabolite, regulatory metabolites in the system can be identified and characterised. The analysis provides information on whether and where the system is functionally differentiated and which of its species are homeostatically buffered. The novelty in our proposed method lies in the fact that all metabolites are considered for SDA (hence the term "generalised"), which removes investigator bias. It supplies an entry point for the further analysis and detailed characterisation of large models of cellular systems, in which the choice of metabolite around which to perform a SDA is not always obvious.},

Here we employ synthetic gene circuits in Escherichia coli to measure the rise-times of non-self-regulated and of negatively autoregulated transcription units. Non-self-regulated units have a rise-time of one cell-cycle. We demonstrate experimentally that negative autoregulation feedback (also termed autogenous control) reduces the rise-time to about one fifth of a cell-cycle. This agrees with an analytical solution of a mathematical model for negative autoregulation. This may help in understanding the function of negative autoregulation, which appears in over 40\% of known transcription factors in E.coli.},

Moderate overexpression of these glycolytic enzymes in A. niger N400 (3-5-fold the wild-type level), either individually or simultaneously, did not increase citric acid production by the fungus significantly. Thus, phosphofructokinase and pyruvate kinase do not seem to contribute in a major way to flux control of the metabolism involved in the conversion of glucose to citric acid. Overexpression of phosphofructokinase and pyruvate kinase did not influence the activities of other enzymes in the pathway, nor did it change intermediary metabolite levels. However, in strains overexpressing phosphofructokinase, the level of fructose 2,6-bisphosphate, a positive allosteric effector of phosphofructokinase, was reduced almost 2-fold compared to the wild-type strain. Measurements with purified phosphofructokinase, using substrate, product and effector concentrations found intracellularly, showed that such a reduction in the fructose-2,6-bisphosphate level could decrease the specific activity of phosphofructokinase in the cell significantly. Thus, the fungus seems to adapt to overexpression of phosphofructokinase by decreasing the specific activity of the enzyme through a reduction in the level of fructose 2,6-bisphosphate.},

At the onset of contraction, there was a rapid utilization of trehalose followed by catabolism of thoracic glycogen and then of the polysaccharide stored in the abdomen. Coincident with the decrease in the concentration of trehalose within the muscle was a rapid and transient increase in that of glucose. The concentrations of the hexose monophosphates were constant or declined. The concentration of fructose-1,6-diphosphate rose with the initiation of flight and then fell. The concentrations of triose phosphates, including [agr]-glycerophosphate, increased slightly, but transiently, or were steady during continuous flight. The concentration of pyruvate increased strikingly at the start of exercise. Initially, pyruvate was largely converted to alanine. There were no accumulations of lactate or citrate. The amino group made available for the enormous increase in the concentration of alanine within the muscle after commencement of flight seems to have been derived largely from proline. The concentration of glutamate was lowered slightly during flight; no significant changes in the concentrations of ammonia, aspartate, glutamine, and asparagine within the muscle were found after initiation of flight. The concentration of malate increased sharply at the onset of active contraction, declined slightly for 2 min, and then remained high throughout the entire flight. The concentrations of [agr]-ketoglutarate and oxaloacetate were apparently not altered.Measurements of coincident changes in metabolites concomitant with the 100-fold increase in glycolytic flux attained on initiation of flight provided an unique system to determine the steps that control glycolysis in vivo, in the transition from a tissue at rest to one performing strenuous work. Three sites of regulation--the phosphorylation of fructose 6-phosphate, the cleavage of trehalose, and the phosphorolysis of glycogen--were established in this system in vivo. Possible additional controls at the oxidations of [agr]-glycerophosphate and of proline are suggested.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: Stochastic simulation has become a useful tool to both study natural biological systems and design new synthetic ones. By capturing the intrinsic molecular fluctuations of "small" systems, these simulations produce a more accurate picture of single cell dynamics, including interesting phenomena missed by deterministic methods, such as noise-induced oscillations and transitions between stable states. However, the computational cost of the original stochastic simulation algorithm can be high, motivating the use of hybrid stochastic methods. Hybrid stochastic methods partition the system into multiple subsets and describe each subset as a different representation, such as a jump Markov, Poisson, continuous Markov, or deterministic process. By applying valid approximations and self-consistently merging disparate descriptions, a method can be considerably faster, while retaining accuracy. In this paper, we describe Hy3S, a collection of multiscale simulation programs. RESULTS: Building on our previous work on developing novel hybrid stochastic algorithms, we have created the Hy3S software package to enable scientists and engineers to both study and design extremely large well-mixed biological systems with many thousands of reactions and chemical species. We have added adaptive stochastic numerical integrators to permit the robust simulation of dynamically stiff biological systems. In addition, Hy3S has many useful features, including embarrassingly parallelized simulations with MPI; special discrete events, such as transcriptional and translation elongation and cell division; mid-simulation perturbations in both the number of molecules of species and reaction kinetic parameters; combinatorial variation of both initial conditions and kinetic parameters to enable sensitivity analysis; use of NetCDF optimized binary format to quickly read and write large datasets; and a simple graphical user interface, written in Matlab, to help users create biological systems and analyze data. We demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of Hy3S with examples, including a large-scale system benchmark and a complex bistable biochemical network with positive feedback. The software itself is open-sourced under the GPL license and is modular, allowing users to modify it for their own purposes. CONCLUSION: Hy3S is a powerful suite of simulation programs for simulating the stochastic dynamics of networks of biochemical reactions. Its first public version enables computational biologists to more efficiently investigate the dynamics of realistic biological systems.},

  Abstract                 = {Stochastic effects in biomolecular systems have now been recognized as a major physiologically and evolutionarily important factor in the development and function of many living organisms. Nevertheless, they are often thought of as providing only moderate refinements to the behaviors otherwise predicted by the classical deterministic system description. In this work we show by using both analytical and numerical investigation that at least in one ubiquitous class of (bio)chemical-reaction mechanisms, enzymatic futile cycles, the external noise may induce a bistable oscillatory (dynamic switching) behavior that is both quantitatively and qualitatively different from what is predicted or possible deterministically. We further demonstrate that the noise required to produce these distinct properties can itself be caused by a set of auxiliary chemical reactions, making it feasible for biological systems of sufficient complexity to generate such behavior internally. This new stochastic dynamics then serves to confer additional functional modalities on the enzymatic futile cycle mechanism that include stochastic amplification and signaling, the characteristics of which could be controlled by both the type and parameters of the driving noise. Hence, such noise-induced phenomena may, among other roles, potentially offer a novel type of control mechanism in pathways that contain these cycles and the like units. In particular, observations of endogenous or externally driven noise-induced dynamics in regulatory networks may thus provide additional insight into their topology, structure, and kinetics.},

This chapter aims at (systems) biologists that have an interest in, but no extensive knowledge of, applying genome-scale metabolic reconstruction and modeling to their organism. Rather than being comprehensive--excellent and extensive reviews exist on every aspect of this field--we give a rather personal account on our experience with the process of reconstruction and modeling. First, we place genome-scale metabolic models in the spectrum of modeling approaches, and rather extensively discuss, for nonexperts, the central concept in constraint-based modeling: the solution space that is bounded through constraints on fluxes. We subsequently provide an overview of the different steps involved in metabolic reconstruction and modeling, pointing to aspects that we found difficult, important, not well enough addressed in the current reviews, or any combination thereof. In this way, we hope that this chapter serves as a practical guide through the field.},

  Abstract                 = {Probably one of the most characteristic features of a living system is its continual propensity to change as it juggles the demands of survival with the need to replicate. Internally these adjustments are manifest as changes in metabolite, protein, and gene activities. Such changes have become increasingly obvious to experimentalists, with the advent of high-throughput technologies. In this chapter we highlight some of the quantitative approaches used to rationalize the study of cellular dynamics. The chapter focuses attention on the analysis of quantitative models based on differential equations using biochemical control theory. Basic pathway motifs are discussed, including straight chain, branched, and cyclic systems. In addition, some of the properties conferred by positive and negative feedback loops are discussed, particularly in relation to bistability and oscillatory dynamics.},

  Abstract                 = {SCAMP is a general-purpose simulator of metabolic and chemical networks. The program is written in C and is portable to all computer systems that support an ANSI C compiler. SCAMP accepts metabolic models described in a biochemical language, and this enables novice as well as experienced users rapidly to build and simulate metabolic systems. The language is sufficiently flexible to enable other types of model to be built, e.g. chemostat or ecological models. The language offers many facilities, including: the ability to describe metabolic pathways of any structure and possessing any kinetics using normal chemical notation; optionally build models directly from the differential equations; differing compartment volumes; access to flux, concentration and rate of change information; detection of conserved cycles; access to all coefficients and elasticities of metabolic control analysis; user-defined forcing functions at the model boundaries; user-defined monitoring functions; user-configurable output of any quantity. From the model description SCAMP can either generate C code for later compilation to produce fast executable stand-alone models or run-time code for input to a run-time interpreter for immediate execution. The simulator also incorporates an inbuilt symbolic differentiator for evaluating the Jacobian and elasticity matrices.},

  Abstract                 = {The local stability of unbranched biosynthetic pathways is examined by mathematical analysis and computer simulation using a novel nonlinear formalism that appears to accurately describe biochemical systems. Four factors affecting the stability are examined: strength of feedback inhibition, equalization of the values among the corresponding kinetic parameters for the reactions of the pathway, pathway length, and alternative patterns of feedback interactions. The strength of inhibition and the pattern of feedback interactions are important determinants of steady-state behavior. The simple pattern of end-product inhibition in unbranched pathways may have evolved because it optimizes the steady-state behavior and is temporally most responsive to change. Stability in these simple systems is achieved by shortening pathway length either physically or, in the case of necessarily long pathways, kinetically by a wide devergence in the values of the corresponding kinetic parameters for the reactions of the pathway. These conclusions are discussed in the light of available experimental evidence.},

  Abstract                 = {Analysis of metabolic networks using linear optimization theory allows one to quantify and understand the limitations imposed on the cell by its metabolic stoichiometry, and to understand how the flux through each pathway influences the overall behavior of metabolism. A stoichiometric matrix accounting for the major pathways involved in energy and mass transformations in the cell was used in our analysis. The auxiliary parameters of linear optimization, the so-called shadow prices, identify the intermediates and cofactors that cause the growth to be limited on each nutrient. This formalism was used to examine how well the cell balances its needs for carbon, nitrogen, and energy during growth on different substrates. The relative values of glucose and glutamine as nutrients were compared by varying the ratio of rates of glucose to glutamine uptakes, and calculating the maximum growth rate. The optimum value of this ratio is between 2-7, similar to experimentally observed ratios. The theoretical maximum growth rate was calculated for growth on each amino acid, and the amino acids catabolized directly to glutamate were found to be the optimal nutrients. The importance of each reaction in the network can be examined both by selectively limiting the flux through the reaction, and by the value of the reduced cost for that reaction. Some reactions, such as malic enzyme and glutamate dehydrogenase, may be inhibited or deleted with little or no adverse effect on the calculated cell growth rate.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND:The need to build a tool to facilitate the quick creation and editing of models encoded in the Systems Biology Markup language (SBML) has been growing with the number of users and the increased complexity of the language. SBMLeditor tries to answer this need by providing a very simple, low level editor of SBML files. Users can create and remove all the necessary bits and pieces of SBML in a controlled way, that maintains the validity of the final SBML file.RESULTS:SBMLeditor is written in JAVA using JCompneur, a library providing interfaces to easily display an XML document as a tree. This decreases dramatically the development time for a new XML editor. The possibility to include custom dialogs for different tags allows a lot of freedom for the editing and validation of the document. In addition to Xerces, SBMLeditor uses libSBML to check the validity and consistency of SBML files. A graphical equation editor allows an easy manipulation of MathML. SBMLeditor can be used as a module of the Systems Biology Workbench.CONCLUSION:SBMLeditor contains many improvements compared to a generic XML editor, and allow users to create an {SBML} model quickly and without syntactic errors.},

Also the simultaneous increase in the activities of pairs of enzymes such as pyruvate kinase and phosphofructokinase or pyruvate decarboxylase and alcohol dehydrogenase, did not increase the rate of ethanol production.

Individual processes are collected within a physical and computational infrastructure that accommodates any molecular mechanism expressible as rate equations or membrane fluxes. An illustration of the method is provided by a dynamic simulation of IP3-mediated Ca2+ release from endoplasmic reticulum in a neuronal cell.

Important algebraic concepts used in pathway analysis, such as null space and convex cone, are explained. It is demonstrated how these concepts can be translated into meaningful metabolic concepts. For example, it is shown that the simplest vectors spanning the region of all admissible fluxes in stationary states, for which the term elementary flux modes was coined, correspond to fundamental pathways in the system. The concepts are illustrated with the help of a reaction scheme representing the glyoxylate cycle and adjacent reactions of aspartate and glutamate synthesis. The interrelations between pathway analysis and metabolic control theory are outlined. Promising applications for genome annotation and for biotechnological purposes are discussed. Armed with a better understanding of the architecture of cellular metabolism and the enormous amount of genomic data available today, biochemists and biotechnologists will be able to draw the entire metabolic map of a cell and redesign it by rational and directed metabolic engineering.},

  Abstract                 = {Within the last decades NMR spectroscopy has undergone tremendous development and has become a powerful analytical tool for the investigation of intracellular flux distributions in biochemical networks using (13)C-labeled substrates. Not only are the experiments much easier to conduct than experiments employing radioactive tracer elements, but NMR spectroscopy also provides additional information on the labeling pattern of the metabolites. Whereas the maximum amount of information obtainable with (14)C-labeled substrates is the fractional enrichment in the individual carbon atom positions, NMR spectroscopy can also provide information on the degree of labeling at neighboring carbon atom positions by analyzing multiplet patterns in NMR spectra or using 2-dimensional NMR spectra. It is possible to quantify the mole fractions of molecules that show a specific labeling pattern, i.e., information of the isotopomer distribution in metabolite pools can be obtained. The isotopomer distribution is the maximum amount of information that in theory can be obtained from (13)C-tracer studies. The wealth of information contained in NMR spectra frequently leads to overdetermined algebraic systems. Consequently, fluxes must be estimated by nonlinear least squares analysis, in which experimental labeling data is compared with simulated steady state isotopomer distributions. Hence, mathematical models are required to compute the steady state isotopomer distribution as a function of a given set of steady state fluxes. Because 2(n) possible labeling patterns exist in a molecule of n carbon atoms, and each pattern corresponds to a separate state in the isotopomer model, these models are inherently complex. Model complexity, so far, has restricted usage of isotopomer information to relatively small metabolic networks. A general methodology for the formulation of isotopomer models is described. The model complexity of isotopomer models is reduced to that of classical metabolic models by expressing the 2(n) isotopomer mass balances of a metabolite pool in a single matrix equation. Using this approach an isotopomer model has been implemented that describes label distribution in primary carbon metabolism, i.e., in a metabolic network including the Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas and pentose phosphate pathway, the tricarboxylic acid cycle, and selected anaplerotic reaction sequences. The model calculates the steady state label distribution in all metabolite pools as a function of the steady state fluxes and is applied to demonstrate the effect of selected anaplerotic fluxes on the labeling pattern of the pathway intermediates.

  Abstract                 = {Stoichiometric analysis of metabolic networks allows the calculation of possible metabolic flux distributions in the absence of kinetic data. In order to predict which of the possible fluxes are present under certain conditions, additional constraints and optimization principles can be applied. One approach of calculating unknown fluxes (frequently called flux balance analysis) is based on the optimality principle of maximizing the molar yield of biotransformations. Here, the relevance and applicability of that approach are examined, and it is compared with the principle of maximizing pathway flux. We discuss diverse experimental evidence showing that, often, those biochemical pathways are operative that allow fast but low-yield synthesis of important products, such as fermentation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and several other yeast species. Together with arguments based on evolutionary game theory, this leads us to the conclusion that maximization of molar yield is by no means a universal principle.},

For components of metabolism, this means mapping fluxes at the level of metabolic networks. Advances in experimental, analytical and software tools for metabolic flux analysis now allow maps of the fluxes through central metabolism to be obtained from the results of stable-isotope-labeling experiments. Such maps have led to notable successes in understanding and engineering metabolic function in microorganisms. Recent studies in plants are giving insight into particular fluxes, such as those of the pentose phosphate pathway, and into general phenomena, such as substrate- or futile-cycles and compartmentation. The importance of experimental design and statistical analysis have been illustrated, and analyses of fluxes in heterotrophic plant tissues have been carried out recently.},

  Abstract                 = {MOTIVATION: Compartments and membranes are the basis of cell topology and more than 30\% of the human genome codes for membrane proteins. While it is possible to represent compartments and membrane proteins in a nominal way with many mathematical formalisms used in systems biology, few, if any, explicitly model the topology of the membranes themselves. Discrete stochastic simulation potentially offers the most accurate representation of cell dynamics. Since the details of every molecular interaction in a pathway are often not known, the relationship between chemical species in not necessarily best described at the lowest level, i.e. by mass action. Simulation is a form of computer-aided analysis, relying on human interpretation to derive meaning. To improve efficiency and gain meaning in an automatic way, it is necessary to have a formalism based on a model which has decidable properties. RESULTS: We present Cyto-Sim, a stochastic simulator of membrane-enclosed hierarchies of biochemical processes, where the membranes comprise an inner, outer and integral layer. The underlying model is based on formal language theory and has been shown to have decidable properties (Cavaliere and Sedwards, 2006), allowing formal analysis in addition to simulation. The simulator provides variable levels of abstraction via arbitrary chemical kinetics which link to ordinary differential equations. In addition to its compact native syntax, Cyto-Sim currently supports models described as Petri nets, can import all versions of SBML and can export SBML and MATLAB m-files. AVAILABILITY: Cyto-Sim is available free, either as an applet or a stand-alone Java program via the web page (http://www.cosbi.eu/Rpty\_Soft\_CytoSim.php). Other versions can be made available upon request.},

  Abstract                 = {The gal regulon of Escherichia coli contains genes involved in galactose transport and metabolism. Transcription of the gal regulon genes is regulated in different ways by two iso-regulatory proteins, Gal repressor (GalR) and Gal isorepressor (GalS), which recognize the same binding sites in the absence of d-galactose. DNA binding by both GalR and GalS is inhibited in the presence of d-galactose. Many of the gal regulon genes are activated in the presence of the adenosine cyclic-3',5'-monophosphate (cAMP)-cAMP receptor protein (CRP) complex. We studied transcriptional regulation of the gal regulon promoters simultaneously in a purified system and attempted to integrate the two small molecule signals, d-galactose and cAMP, that modulate the isoregulators and CRP respectively, at each promoter, using Boolean logic. Results show that similarly organized promoters can have different input functions. We also found that in some cases the activity of the promoter and the cognate gene can be described by different logic gates. We combined the transcriptional network of the galactose regulon, obtained from our experiments, with literature data to construct an integrated map of the galactose network. Structural analysis of the network shows that at the interface of the genetic and metabolic network, feedback loops are by far the most common motif.},

  Abstract                 = {Cytoscape is an open source software project for integrating biomolecular interaction networks with high-throughput expression data and other molecular states into a unified conceptual framework. Although applicable to any system of molecular components and interactions, Cytoscape is most powerful when used in conjunction with large databases of protein-protein, protein-DNA, and genetic interactions that are increasingly available for humans and model organisms. Cytoscape's software Core provides basic functionality to layout and query the network; to visually integrate the network with expression profiles, phenotypes, and other molecular states; and to link the network to databases of functional annotations. The Core is extensible through a straightforward plug-in architecture, allowing rapid development of additional computational analyses and features. Several case studies of Cytoscape plug-ins are surveyed, including a search for interaction pathways correlating with changes in gene expression, a study of protein complexes involved in cellular recovery to DNA damage, inference of a combined physical/functional interaction network for Halobacterium, and an interface to detailed stochastic/kinetic gene regulatory models.},

It converts SBML models into Mathematica data structures and provides a platform for manipulating and evaluating these models. Once a model is read by MathSBML, it is fully compatible with standard Mathematica functions such as NDSolve (a differential-algebraic equations solver). MathSBML also provides an application programming interface for viewing, manipulating, running numerical simulations; exporting SBML models; and converting SBML models in to other formats, such as XPP, HTML and FORTRAN. By accessing the full breadth of Mathematica functionality, MathSBML is fully extensible to SBML models of any size or complexity.

  Abstract                 = {The relationship between the topology of a biological network and its functional or evolutionary properties has attracted much recent interest. It has been suggested that most, if not all, biological networks are 'scale free.' That is, their connections follow power-law distributions, such that there are very few nodes with very many connections and vice versa. The number of target genes of known transcriptional regulators in the yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, appears to follow such a distribution, as do other networks, such as the yeast network of protein-protein interactions. These findings have inspired attempts to draw biological inferences from general properties associated with scale-free network topology. One often cited general property is that, when compromised, highly connected nodes will tend to have a larger effect on network function than sparsely connected nodes. For example, more highly connected proteins are more likely to be lethal when knocked out. However, the correlation between lethality and connectivity is relatively weak, and some highly connected proteins can be removed without noticeable phenotypic effect. Similarly, network topology only weakly predicts the response of gene expression to environmental perturbations. Evolutionary simulations of gene-regulatory networks, presented here, suggest that such weak or non-existent correlations are to be expected, and are likely not due to inadequacy of experimental data. We argue that 'top-down' inferences of biological properties based on simple measures of network topology are of limited utility, and we present simulation results suggesting that much more detailed information about a gene's location in a regulatory network, as well as dynamic gene-expression data, are needed to make more meaningful functional and evolutionary predictions. Specifically, we find in our simulations that: (1) the relationship between a gene's connectivity and its fitness effect upon knockout depends on its equilibrium expression level; (2) correlation between connectivity and genetic variation is virtually non-existent, yet upon independent evolution of networks with identical topologies, some nodes exhibit consistently low or high polymorphism; and (3) certain genes show low polymorphism yet high divergence among independent evolutionary runs. This latter pattern is generally taken as a signature of positive selection, but in our simulations its cause is often neutral coevolution of regulatory inputs to the same gene.},

  abstract = {<p>We present an experimental and computational pipeline for the generation of kinetic models of metabolism, and demonstrate its application to glycolysis in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Starting from an approximate mathematical model, we employ a "cycle of knowledge" strategy, identifying the steps with most control over flux. Kinetic parameters of the individual isoenzymes within these steps are measured experimentally under a standardised set of conditions. Experimental strategies are applied to establish a set of in vivo concentrations for isoenzymes and metabolites. The data are integrated into a mathematical model that is used to predict a new set of metabolite concentrations and reevaluate the control properties of the system. This bottom-up modelling study reveals that control over the metabolic network most directly involved in yeast glycolysis is more widely distributed than previously thought.</p>},

  abstract =    {This article presents libRoadRunner, an extensible, high-performance, cross-platform, open-source software library for the simulation and analysis of models expressed using Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML). SBML is the most widely used standard for representing dynamic networks, especially biochemical networks. libRoadRunner is fast enough to support large-scale problems such as tissue models, studies that require large numbers of repeated runs and interactive simulations.libRoadRunner is a self-contained library, able to run both as a component inside other tools via its C++ and C bindings, and interactively through its Python interface. Its Python Application Programming Interface (API) is similar to the APIs of MATLAB ( WWWMATHWORKSCOM: ) and SciPy ( HTTP//WWWSCIPYORG/: ), making it fast and easy to learn. libRoadRunner uses a custom Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler built on the widely used LLVM JIT compiler framework. It compiles SBML-specified models directly into native machine code for a variety of processors, making it appropriate for solving extremely large models or repeated runs. libRoadRunner is flexible, supporting the bulk of the SBML specification (except for delay and non-linear algebraic equations) including several SBML extensions (composition and distributions). It offers multiple deterministic and stochastic integrators, as well as tools for steady-state analysis, stability analysis and structural analysis of the stoichiometric matrix.libRoadRunner binary distributions are available for Mac OS X, Linux and Windows. The library is licensed under Apache License Version 2.0. libRoadRunner is also available for ARM-based computers such as the Raspberry Pi. http://www.libroadrunner.org provides online documentation, full build instructions, binaries and a git source repository.hsauro@u.washington.edu or somogyie@indiana.eduSupplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

  Abstract                 = {Cellular metabolism is characterized by an intricate network of interactions between biochemical fluxes, metabolic compounds and regulatory interactions. To investigate and eventually understand the emergent global behavior arising from such networks of interaction is not possible by intuitive reasoning alone. This contribution seeks to describe recent computational approaches that aim to asses the topological and functional properties of metabolic networks. In particular, based on a recently proposed method, it is shown that it is possible to acquire a quantitative picture of the possible dynamics of metabolic systems, without assuming detailed knowledge of the underlying enzyme-kinetic rate equations and parameters. Rather, the method builds upon a statistical exploration of the comprehensive parameter space to evaluate the dynamic capabilities of a metabolic system, thus providing a first step towards the transition from topology to function of metabolic pathways. Utilizing this approach, the role of feedback mechanisms in the maintenance of stability is discussed using minimal models of cellular pathways.},

  Abstract                 = {One defining goal of synthetic biology is the development of engineering-based approaches that enable the construction of gene-regulatory networks according to 'design specifications' generated from computational modelling. This approach provides a systematic framework for exploring how a given regulatory network generates a particular phenotypic behaviour. Several fundamental gene circuits have been developed using this approach, including toggle switches and oscillators, and these have been applied in new contexts such as triggered biofilm development and cellular population control. Here we describe an engineered genetic oscillator in Escherichia coli that is fast, robust and persistent, with tunable oscillatory periods as fast as 13 min. The oscillator was designed using a previously modelled network architecture comprising linked positive and negative feedback loops. Using a microfluidic platform tailored for single-cell microscopy, we precisely control environmental conditions and monitor oscillations in individual cells through multiple cycles. Experiments reveal remarkable robustness and persistence of oscillations in the designed circuit; almost every cell exhibited large-amplitude fluorescence oscillations throughout observation runs. The oscillatory period can be tuned by altering inducer levels, temperature and the media source. Computational modelling demonstrates that the key design principle for constructing a robust oscillator is a time delay in the negative feedback loop, which can mechanistically arise from the cascade of cellular processes involved in forming a functional transcription factor. The positive feedback loop increases the robustness of the oscillations and allows for greater tunability. Examination of our refined model suggested the existence of a simplified oscillator design without positive feedback, and we construct an oscillator strain confirming this computational prediction.},

The trend in the development of these tools is to go beyond 'static' representations of cellular state, towards a more dynamic model of cellular processes through the incorporation of gene expression data, subcellular localization information and time-dependent behavior. We provide a comprehensive review of the relative advantages and disadvantages of existing systems with two goals in mind: to aid researchers in efficiently identifying the appropriate existing tools for data visualization; to describe the necessary and realistic goals for the next generation of visualization tools. In view of the first goal, we provide in the Supplementary Material a systematic comparison of more than 35 existing tools in terms of over 25 different features.

  Abstract                 = {The homeostatic framework has dominated our understanding of cellular physiology. We question whether homeostasis alone adequately explains microbial responses to environmental stimuli, and explore the capacity of intracellular networks for predictive behavior in a fashion similar to metazoan nervous systems. We show that in silico biochemical networks, evolving randomly under precisely defined complex habitats, capture the dynamical, multidimensional structure of diverse environments by forming internal representations that allow prediction of environmental change. We provide evidence for such anticipatory behavior by revealing striking correlations of Escherichia coli transcriptional responses to temperature and oxygen perturbations-precisely mirroring the covariation of these parameters upon transitions between the outside world and the mammalian gastrointestinal tract. We further show that these internal correlations reflect a true associative learning paradigm, because they show rapid decoupling upon exposure to novel environments.},

The main concept that underlies whole-network metabolic modeling is the identification and mathematical definition of constraints. Here, we review large-scale metabolic network modeling, in particular, stoichiometric- and constraint-based approaches. Although many such models have been reconstructed, few networks have been extensively validated and tested experimentally, and we focus on these. We describe how metabolic networks can be represented using stoichiometric matrices and well-defined constraints on metabolic fluxes. We then discuss relatively successful approaches, including flux balance analysis (FBA), pathway analysis, and common extensions or modifications to these approaches. Finally, we describe techniques for integrating these approaches with models of other biological processes.},

Traditionally, process optimization for these applications involved both strain selection and trial and error. More recently, metabolic engineering has emerged as a discipline that focuses on the rational improvement of industrially useful strains. In the post-genomic era, metabolic engineering increasingly benefits from systems biology, an approach that combines mathematical modelling techniques with functional-genomics data to build models for biological interpretation and--ultimately--prediction. In this review, the industrial applications of LAB are mapped onto available global, genome-scale metabolic modelling techniques to evaluate the extent to which functional genomics and systems biology can live up to their industrial promise.},

These reconstructions represent structured knowledge bases that abstract pertinent information on the biochemical transformations taking place within specific target organisms. The conversion of a reconstruction into a mathematical format facilitates a myriad of computational biological studies, including evaluation of network content, hypothesis testing and generation, analysis of phenotypic characteristics and metabolic engineering. To date, genome-scale metabolic reconstructions for more than 30 organisms have been published and this number is expected to increase rapidly. However, these reconstructions differ in quality and coverage that may minimize their predictive potential and use as knowledge bases. Here we present a comprehensive protocol describing each step necessary to build a high-quality genome-scale metabolic reconstruction, as well as the common trials and tribulations. Therefore, this protocol provides a helpful manual for all stages of the reconstruction process.},

This Review of in vitro studies, human tumour data and recent mouse models shows that p53 post-translational modifications have modulatory roles, and MDM2 and MDM4 have more profound roles for regulating p53.

  Abstract                 = {Two large-scale yeast two-hybrid screens were undertaken to identify protein-protein interactions between full-length open reading frames predicted from the Saccharomyces cerevisiae genome sequence. In one approach, we constructed a protein array of about 6,000 yeast transformants, with each transformant expressing one of the open reading frames as a fusion to an activation domain. This array was screened by a simple and automated procedure for 192 yeast proteins, with positive responses identified by their positions in the array. In a second approach, we pooled cells expressing one of about 6,000 activation domain fusions to generate a library. We used a high-throughput screening procedure to screen nearly all of the 6,000 predicted yeast proteins, expressed as Gal4 DNA-binding domain fusion proteins, against the library, and characterized positives by sequence analysis. These approaches resulted in the detection of 957 putative interactions involving 1,004 S. cerevisiae proteins. These data reveal interactions that place functionally unclassified proteins in a biological context, interactions between proteins involved in the same biological function, and interactions that link biological functions together into larger cellular processes. The results of these screens are shown here.},

The formal relationships between different stochastic models referred to in the systems biology literature are reviewed. As part of this review, a novel derivation of the differential Chapman-Kolmogorov equation for a general multidimensional Markov process made up of both continuous and jump processes, is presented. First, the definition of a time-derivative for a probability density is focused, but placing no restrictions on the probability distribution, in particular, it is not assumed to be to be confined to a region that has a surface (on which the probability is zero). In this derivation, the master equation gives the jump part of the Markov process and the Fokker-Planck equation gives the continuous part. As a result, a 'family tree' for stochastic models in systems biology is sketched, providing explicit derivations of their formal relationship and clarifying assumptions involved.},

Exhaustive descriptions of the metabolism can be obtained by computing the elementary vectors of this cone but, owing to a combinatorial explosion of the number of elementary vectors, this approach becomes computationally intractable for genome scale networks. RESULT: Hence, we propose to instead focus on the conversion cone, a projection of the flux cone, which describes the interaction of the metabolism with its external chemical environment. We present a direct method for calculating the elementary vectors of this cone and, by studying the metabolism of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we demonstrate that such an analysis is computationally feasible even for genome scale networks.},

This work has opened the door to the molecular understanding of how a prokaryotic repressor can be correctly positioned at specific DNA sequences with the help of a global activator, and how the repressor subsequently inhibits factor-dependent transcription initiation.},

Fluorescent biosensors can be genetically targeted to distinct locations within cells, such as organelles and membranes. This feature facilitates elucidation of how protein activities and cellular signals are modulated in different regions of the cell.

abstract="Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) defined as reversible association of two proteins to form a complex, are undoubtedly among the most common interaction motifs featured in cells. Recent large-scale proteomic studies have revealed an enormously complex interactome of the cell, consisting of tens of thousands of PPIs with numerous signalling hubs. PPIs have functional roles in regulating a wide range of cellular processes including signal transduction and post-translational modifications, and de-regulation of PPIs is implicated in many diseases including cancers and neuro-degenerative disorders. Despite the ubiquitous appearance and physiological significance of PPIs, our understanding of the dynamic and functional consequences of these simple motifs remains incomplete, particularly when PPIs occur within large biochemical networks. We employ quantitative, dynamic modelling to computationally analyse salient dynamic features of the PPI motifs and PPI-containing signalling networks varying in topological architecture. Our analyses surprisingly reveal that simple reversible PPI motifs, when being embedded into signalling cascades, could give rise to extremely rich and complex regulatory dynamics in the absence of explicit positive and negative feedback loops. Our work represents a systematic investigation of the dynamic properties of PPIs in signalling networks, and the results shed light on how this simple event may potentiate diverse and intricate behaviours in vivo.",

  Abstract                 = {The strategy of combining genes from a regulatory protein and its antagonist within the same operon, but controlling their activities differentially, can lead to diverse regulatory functions. This protein-antagonist motif is ubiquitous and present in evolutionarily unrelated regulatory pathways. Using the sin operon from the Bacillus subtilis sporulation pathway as a model system, we built a theoretical model, parameterized it using data from the literature, and used bifurcation analyses to determine the circuit functions it could encode. The model demonstrated that this motif can generate a bistable switch with tunable control over the switching threshold and the degree of population heterogeneity. Further, the model predicted that a small perturbation of a single critical parameter can bias this architecture into functioning like a graded response, a bistable switch, an oscillator, or a pulse generator. By mapping the parameters of the model to specific DNA regions and comparing the genomic sequences of Bacillus species, we showed that phylogenetic variation tends to occur in those regions that tune the switch threshold without disturbing the circuit function. The dynamical plasticity of the protein-antagonist operon motif suggests that it is an evolutionarily convergent design selected not only for particular immediate function but also for its evolvability.},

  Abstract                 = {The combination of high-throughput methods of molecular biology with advanced mathematical and computational techniques has propelled the emergent field of systems biology into a position of prominence. Unthinkable a decade ago, it has become possible to screen and analyze the expression of entire genomes, simultaneously assess large numbers of proteins and their prevalence, and characterize in detail the metabolic state of a cell population. Although very important, the focus on comprehensive networks of biological components is only one side of systems biology. Complementing large-scale assessments, and sometimes at the risk of being forgotten, are more subtle analyses that rationalize the design and functioning of biological modules in exquisite detail. This intricate side of systems biology aims at identifying the specific roles of processes and signals in smaller, fully regulated systems by computing what would happen if these signals were lacking or organized in a different fashion. We exemplify this type of approach with a detailed analysis of the regulation of glucose utilization in Lactococcus lactis. This organism is exposed to alternating periods of glucose availability and starvation. During starvation, it accumulates an intermediate of glycolysis, which allows it to take up glucose immediately upon availability. This notable accumulation poses a nontrivial control task that is solved with an unusual, yet ingeniously designed and timed feedforward activation system. The elucidation of this control system required high-precision, dynamic in vivo metabolite data, combined with methods of nonlinear systems analysis, and may serve as a paradigm for multidisciplinary approaches to fine-scaled systems biology.},

  Abstract                 = {The analysis of metabolic networks has become a major topic in biotechnology in recent years. Applications range from the enhanced production of selected outputs to the prediction of genotype-phenotype relationships. The concepts used are based on the assumption of a pseudo steady-state of the network, so that for each metabolite inputs and outputs are balanced. The stoichiometric network analysis expands the steady state into a combination of nonredundant subnetworks with positive coefficients called extremal currents. Based on the unidirectional representation of the system these subnetworks form a convex cone in the flux-space. A modification of this approach allowing for reversible reactions led to the definition of elementary modes. Extreme pathways are obtained with the same method but splitting up internal reactions into forward and backward rates. In this study, we explore the relationship between these concepts. Due to the combinatorial explosion of the number of elementary modes in large networks, we promote a further set of metabolic routes, which we call the minimal generating set. It is the smallest subset of elementary modes required to describe all steady states of the system. For large-scale networks, the size of this set is of several magnitudes smaller than that of elementary modes and of extreme pathways.},

  Abstract                 = {The control exerted by the adenine nucleotide translocator and the ADP-regenerating system on oxidative phosphorylation was studied in isolated rat-liver mitochondria respiring with succinate. At intermediate rates of respiration the flux control coefficient (control strength) of the adenine nucleotide translocator on respiration was much higher with creatine/creatine kinase than with glucose/hexokinase as the ADP-regenerating system. In contrast, at the same rate of respiration the flux control coefficient of creatine kinase was much lower than that of hexokinase. On addition of a small amount of carboxyatractyloside to mitochondria respiring in the presence of glucose/hexokinase or creatine/creatine kinase, the rate of respiration decreased abruptly and then increased again to a new steady state which was lower with creatine/creatine kinase than with glucose/hexokinase. In the new steady state, the extramitochondrial ATP/ADP ratio was lower with glucose/hexokinase than with creatine/creatine kinase. At the same rate of respiration, the elasticity coefficient of creatine kinase towards the extramitochondrial ATP/ADP ratio was much higher than that of hexokinase. The connectivity theorem [Kacser, H. and Burns, J.A. (1973) in Rate Control of Biological Processes (Davies, D.D., ed.) pp. 65-104, Cambridge University Press, London] which relates the flux control coefficients of two adjacent enzymes to their elasticity coefficients towards the common intermediate, provides an explanation for the difference in flux control coefficient of the adenine nucleotide translocator with the two ADP-regenerating systems. Using principles developed by R. Heinrich and T.A. Rapoport [BioSystems 7, 130-136 (1975)], the flux control coefficients of the adenine nucleotide translocator and hexokinase on phosphorylation were also calculated from the elasticity coefficients of these enzymes towards the extramitochondrial ATP/ADP ratio and the controls exerted by these enzymes on the extramitochondrial ATP/ADP ratio. The calculated values were approximately 30% lower than the values measured directly. The elasticity coefficient of the adenine nucleotide translocator towards the extramitochondrial ATP/ADP ratio was determined, using either the connectivity theorem of Kacser and Burns (loc. cit.) or a new connectivity theorem developed by Westerhoff (following paper in this journal). Good agreement was obtained using the different methods of calculation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

  Abstract                 = {Decomposing transcriptional regulatory networks into functional modules and determining logical relations between them is the first step toward understanding transcriptional regulation at the system level. Modules based on analysis of genome-scale data can serve as the basis for inferring combinatorial regulation and for building mathematical models to quantitatively describe the behavior of the networks. We present here an algorithm called modem to identify target genes of a transcription factor (TF) from a single expression experiment, based on a joint probabilistic model for promoter sequence and gene expression data. We show how this method can facilitate the discovery of specific instances of combinatorial regulation and illustrate this for a specific case of transcriptional networks that regulate sporulation in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Applying this method to analyze two crucial TFs in sporulation, Ndt80p and Sum1p, we were able to delineate their overlapping binding sites. We proposed a mechanistic model for the competitive regulation by the two TFs on a defined subset of sporulation genes. We show that this model accounts for the temporal control of the "middle" sporulation genes and suggest a similar regulatory arrangement can be found in developmental programs in higher organisms.},

In this paper, we study the number of positive steady states of a general multisite phosphorylation-dephosphorylation cycle, and how the number of positive steady states varies by changing the biological parameters. We show analytically that (1) for some parameter ranges, there are at least n + 1 (if n is even) or n (if n is odd) steady states; (2) there never are more than 2n - 1 steady states (in particular, this implies that for n = 2, including single levels of MAPK cascades, there are at most three steady states); (3) for parameters near the standard Michaelis-Menten quasi-steady state conditions, there are at most n + 1 steady states; and (4) for parameters far from the standard Michaelis-Menten quasi-steady state conditions, there is at most one steady state.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: Metabolic Flux Analysis (MFA) based on isotope labeling experiments (ILEs) is a widely established tool for determining fluxes in metabolic pathways. Isotope labeling networks (ILNs) contain all essential information required to describe the flow of labeled material in an ILE. Whereas recent experimental progress paves the way for high-throughput MFA, large network investigations and exact statistical methods, these developments are still limited by the poor performance of computational routines used for the evaluation and design of ILEs. In this context, the global analysis of ILN topology turns out to be a clue for realizing large speedup factors in all required computational procedures. RESULTS: With a strong focus on the speedup of algorithms the topology of ILNs is investigated using graph theoretic concepts and algorithms. A rigorous determination of all cyclic and isomorphic subnetworks, accompanied by the global analysis of ILN connectivity is performed. Particularly, it is proven that ILNs always brake up into a large number of small strongly connected components (SCCs) and, moreover, there are natural isomorphisms between many of these SCCs. All presented techniques are universal, i.e. they do not require special assumptions on the network structure, bidirectionality of fluxes, measurement configuration, or label input. The general results are exemplified with a practically relevant metabolic network which describes the central metabolism of E. coli comprising 10390 isotopomer pools. CONCLUSION: Exploiting the topological features of ILNs leads to a significant speedup of all universal algorithms for ILE evaluation. It is proven in theory and exemplified with the E. coli example that a speedup factor of about 1000 compared to standard algorithms is achieved. This widely opens the door for new high performance algorithms suitable for high throughput applications and large ILNs. Moreover, for the first time the global topological analysis of ILNs allows to comprehensively describe and understand the general patterns of label flow in complex networks. This is an invaluable tool for the structural design of new experiments and the interpretation of measured data.},

  Abstract                 = {The last few years have brought tremendous progress in experimental methods for metabolic flux determination by carbon-labeling experiments. A significant enlargement of the available measurement data set has been achieved, especially when isotopomer fractions within intracellular metabolite pools are quantitated. This information can be used to improve the statistical quality of flux estimates. Furthermore, several assumptions on bidirectional intracellular reaction steps that were hitherto indispensable may now become obsolete. To make full use of the complete measurement information a general mathematical model for isotopomer systems is established in this contribution. Then, by introducing the important new concept of cumomers and cumomer fractions, it is shown that the arising nonlinear isotopomer balance equations can be solved analytically in all cases. In particular, the solution of the metabolite flux balances and the positional carbon-labeling balances presented in part I of this series turn out to be just the first two steps of the general solution procedure for isotopomer balances. A detailed analysis of the isotopomer network structure then opens up new insights into the intrinsic structure of isotopomer systems. In particular, it turns out that isotopomer systems are not as complex as they appear at first glance. This enables some far-reaching conclusions to be drawn on the information potential of isotopomer experiments with respect to flux identification. Finally, some illustrative examples are examined to show that an information increase is not guaranteed when isotopomer measurements are used in addition to positional enrichment data.},

  Abstract                 = {In the last few years metabolic flux analysis (MFA) using carbon labeling experiments (CLE) has become a major diagnostic tool in metabolic engineering. The mathematical centerpiece of MFA is the solution of isotopomer labeling systems (ILS). An ILS is a high-dimensional nonlinear differential equation system that describes the distribution of isotopomers over a metabolic network during a carbon labeling experiment. This contribution presents a global analysis of the dynamic behavior of general ILSs. It is proven that an ILS is globally stable under very weak conditions that are always satisfied in practice. In particular it is shown that in some sense ILSs are a nonlinear extension to the classical theory of compartmental systems. The central stability condition for compartmental systems, i.e., the non-existence of traps in linear compartmental networks, is also the major stability condition for ILSs. As an important side result of the proof, it is shown that ILSs can be transformed to a cascade of linear systems with time-dependent inhomogeneous terms. This cascade structure has considerable consequences for the development of efficient numerical algorithms for the solution of ILSs and thus for MFA.},

The currently used metabolic modeling approaches can be subdivided into structural models, stoichiometric models, carbon flux models, stationary and nonstationary mechanistic models and models with gene regulation. However, the power of a model strongly depends on its basic modeling assumptions, the simplifications made and the data sources used. Model validation turns out to be particularly difficult for metabolic systems. The different modeling approaches are critically reviewed with respect to their potential and benefits for the metabolic engineering cycle. Several tools that have emerged from the different modeling approaches including structural pathway synthesis, stoichiometric pathway analysis, metabolic flux analysis, metabolic control analysis, optimization of regulatory architectures and the evaluation of rapid sampling experiments are discussed.},

  Abstract                 = {Metabolic flux analysis using 13C labeled substrates is an important tool for metabolic engineering. Although it has now been evolving for more than ten years, metabolic flux analysis has still not reached the limits of its application. Current developments aim at extending to instationary industrial production conditions like batch and fed-batch fermentations on the one hand, and at miniaturization and high throughput flux analysis on the other. In both cases, reducing the duration of the labeling experiment is of major interest. For that reason, there is now interest in the instationary transient of the 13C enrichment during a labeling experiment. This paper presents some recent developments in the field of instationary metabolic flux analysis and discusses some critical aspects and limitations using some simulation examples.},

  Abstract                 = {We study the structural robustness of metabolic networks on the basis of the concept of elementary flux modes. It is shown that the number of elementary modes itself is not an appropriate measure of structural robustness. Instead, we introduce three new robustness measures. These are based on the relative number of elementary modes remaining after the knockout of enzymes. We discuss the relevance of these measures with the help of simple examples, as well as with larger, realistic metabolic networks. Thereby we demonstrate quantitatively that the metabolism of Escherichia coli, which must be able to adapt to varying conditions, is more robust than the metabolism of the human erythrocyte, which lives under much more homeostatic conditions.},

  Abstract                 = {Engineered biological systems hold promise in addressing pressing human needs in chemical processing, energy production, materials construction, and maintenance and enhancement of human health and the environment. However, significant advancements in our ability to engineer biological systems have been limited by the foundational tools available for reporting on, responding to, and controlling intracellular components in living systems. Portable and scalable platforms are needed for the reliable construction of such communication and control systems across diverse organisms. We report an extensible RNA-based framework for engineering ligand-controlled gene-regulatory systems, called ribozyme switches, that exhibits tunable regulation, design modularity, and target specificity. These switch platforms contain a sensor domain, comprised of an aptamer sequence, and an actuator domain, comprised of a hammerhead ribozyme sequence. We examined two modes of standardized information transmission between these domains and demonstrate a mechanism that allows for the reliable and modular assembly of functioning synthetic RNA switches and regulation of ribozyme activity in response to various effectors. In addition to demonstrating examples of small molecule-responsive, in vivo functional, allosteric hammerhead ribozymes, this work describes a general approach for the construction of portable and scalable gene-regulatory systems. We demonstrate the versatility of the platform in implementing application-specific control systems for small molecule-mediated regulation of cell growth and noninvasive in vivo sensing of metabolite production.},

Analytical methods to identify the topology of metabolic networks and to quantify fluxes through its different pathways are therefore in the core of metabolic engineering. An elegant approach for metabolic flux analysis is provided by tracer experiments. In such studies tracer substrates with stable isotopes such as 13C are applied and the labeling pattern of metabolites is subsequently measured. Detailed flux distributions can be obtained by a combination of tracer experiments and stoichiometric balancing. In recent years, mass spectrometry (MS) has emerged as an interesting method for labeling measurements in metabolic flux analysis and provided valuable insights into the cellular metabolism. The present review provides an overview on current experimental and modeling tools for metabolic flux analysis by MS. The application of MS for flux analysis is illustrated by examples from the literature for various biological systems, including bacteria, fungi, tissue cultures and in vivo studies in humans.},

  Abstract                 = {Systems theory and cell biology have enjoyed a long relationship that has received renewed interest in recent years in the context of systems biology. The term 'systems' in systems biology comes from systems theory or dynamic systems theory: systems biology is defined through the application of systems- and signal-oriented approaches for an understanding of inter- and intra-cellular dynamic processes. The aim of the present text is to review the systems and control perspective of dynamic systems. The biologist's conceptual framework for representing the variables of a biochemical reaction network, and for describing their relationships, are pathway maps. A principal goal of systems biology is to turn these static maps into dynamic models, which can provide insight into the temporal evolution of biochemical reaction networks. Towards this end, we review the case for differential equation models as a 'natural' representation of causal entailment in pathways. Block-diagrams, commonly used in the engineering sciences, are introduced and compared to pathway maps. The stimulus-response representation of a molecular system is a necessary condition for an understanding of dynamic interactions among the components that make up a pathway. Using simple examples, we show how biochemical reactions are modelled in the dynamic systems framework and visualized using block-diagrams.},

  Abstract                 = {The principal aim of systems biology is to search for general principles that govern living systems. We develop an abstract dynamic model of a cell, rooted in Mesarovi? and Takahara's general systems theory. In this conceptual framework the function of the cell is delineated by the dynamic processes it can realize. We abstract basic cellular processes, i.e., metabolism, signalling, gene expression, into a mapping and consider cell functions, i.e., cell differentiation, proliferation, etc. as processes that determine the basic cellular processes that realize a particular cell function. We then postulate the existence of a 'coordination principle' that determines cell function. These ideas are condensed into a theorem: If basic cellular processes for the control and regulation of cell functions are present, then the coordination of cell functions is realized autonomously from within the system. Inspired by Robert Rosen's notion of closure to efficient causation, introduced as a necessary condition for a natural system to be an organism, we show that for a mathematical model of a self-organizing cell the associated category must be cartesian closed. Although the semantics of our cell model differ from Rosen's (M,R)-systems, the proof of our theorem supports (in parts) Rosen's argument that living cells have non-simulable properties. Whereas models that form cartesian closed categories can capture self-organization (which is a, if not the, fundamental property of living systems), conventional computer simulations of these models (such as virtual cells) cannot. Simulations can mimic living systems, but they are not like living systems.},

  Abstract                 = {MOTIVATION: Metabolic Control Analysis is one of many disciplines that make use of scaled derivatives. In particular, 'elasticities' are used to quantify the effect of an effector or substrate concentration on an enzyme rate under locally specified conditions. Normally an algebraic expression for the elasticity of an enzyme is obtained by differentiating its rate law, multiplying by the effector concentration and dividing by the rate law itself: this results in considerable expression expansion, and when the results are subsequently simplified it is often at the expense of biological comprehensibility. RESULTS: We present a novel algorithm which not only circumvents the expression expansion, but preserves an elegant separation of the components in enzyme behaviour. Easily implemented, and producing gains in both performance and numerical precision, the algorithm is potentially applicable to a number of existing packages. It also greatly assists the manual derivation and evaluation of elasticities, allowing the elasticity of even quite complex enzyme systems to be written by inspection.},

  Abstract                 = {Genes and proteins generate molecular circuitry that enables the cell to process information and respond to stimuli. A major challenge is to identify characteristic patterns in this network of interactions that may shed light on basic cellular mechanisms. Previous studies have analyzed aspects of this network, concentrating on either transcription-regulation or protein-protein interactions. Here we search for composite network motifs: characteristic network patterns consisting of both transcription-regulation and protein-protein interactions that recur significantly more often than in random networks. To this end we developed algorithms for detecting motifs in networks with two or more types of interactions and applied them to an integrated data set of protein-protein interactions and transcription regulation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We found a two-protein mixed-feedback loop motif, five types of three-protein motifs exhibiting coregulation and complex formation, and many motifs involving four proteins. Virtually all four-protein motifs consisted of combinations of smaller motifs. This study presents a basic framework for detecting the building blocks of networks with multiple types of interactions.},

  Abstract                 = {The cyclic AMP (cAMP)-dependent catabolite repression effect in Escherichia coli is among the most intensely studied regulatory processes in biology. However, the physiological function(s) of cAMP signalling and its molecular triggers remain elusive. Here we use a quantitative physiological approach to show that cAMP signalling tightly coordinates the expression of catabolic proteins with biosynthetic and ribosomal proteins, in accordance with the cellular metabolic needs during exponential growth. The expression of carbon catabolic genes increased linearly with decreasing growth rates upon limitation of carbon influx, but decreased linearly with decreasing growth rate upon limitation of nitrogen or sulphur influx. In contrast, the expression of biosynthetic genes showed the opposite linear growth-rate dependence as the catabolic genes. A coarse-grained mathematical model provides a quantitative framework for understanding and predicting gene expression responses to catabolic and anabolic limitations. A scheme of integral feedback control featuring the inhibition of cAMP signalling by metabolic precursors is proposed and validated. These results reveal a key physiological role of cAMP-dependent catabolite repression: to ensure that proteomic resources are spent on distinct metabolic sectors as needed in different nutrient environments. Our findings underscore the power of quantitative physiology in unravelling the underlying functions of complex molecular signalling networks.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: Quantitative knowledge of intracellular fluxes is important for a comprehensive characterization of metabolic networks and their functional operation. In contrast to direct assessment of metabolite concentrations, in vivo metabolite fluxes must be inferred indirectly from measurable quantities in 13C experiments. The required experience, the complicated network models, large and heterogeneous data sets, and the time-consuming set-up of highly controlled experimental conditions largely restricted metabolic flux analysis to few expert groups. A conceptual simplification of flux analysis is the analytical determination of metabolic flux ratios exclusively from MS data, which can then be used in a second step to estimate absolute in vivo fluxes. RESULTS: Here we describe the user-friendly software package FiatFlux that supports flux analysis for non-expert users. In the first module, ratios of converging fluxes are automatically calculated from GC-MS-detected 13C-pattern in protein-bound amino acids. Predefined fragmentation patterns are automatically identified and appropriate statistical data treatment is based on the comparison of redundant information in the MS spectra. In the second module, absolute intracellular fluxes may be calculated by a 13C-constrained flux balancing procedure that combines experimentally determined fluxes in and out of the cell and the above flux ratios. The software is preconfigured to derive flux ratios and absolute in vivo fluxes from [1-13C] and [U-13C]glucose experiments and GC-MS analysis of amino acids for a variety of microorganisms. CONCLUSION: FiatFlux is an intuitive tool for quantitative investigations of intracellular metabolism by users that are not familiar with numerical methods or isotopic tracer experiments. The aim of this open source software is to enable non-specialists to adapt the software to their specific scientific interests, including other 13C-substrates, labeling mixtures, and organisms.},

In this work, we generated time-resolved physiological data, quantitative metabolome (69 intracellular metabolites) and proteome (72 enzymes) profiles. We found that the diauxic shift is accomplished by three key events that are temporally organized: (i) a reduction in the glycolytic flux and the production of storage compounds before glucose depletion, mediated by downregulation of phosphofructokinase and pyruvate kinase reactions; (ii) upon glucose exhaustion, the reversion of carbon flow through glycolysis and onset of the glyoxylate cycle operation triggered by an increased expression of the enzymes that catalyze the malate synthase and cytosolic citrate synthase reactions; and (iii) in the later stages of the adaptation, the shutting down of the pentose phosphate pathway with a change in NADPH regeneration. Moreover, we identified the transcription factors associated with the observed changes in protein abundances. Taken together, our results represent an important contribution toward a systems-level understanding of how this adaptation is realized.},

Here we measured promoter activity for approximately 100 genes in parallel from living cells at a resolution of minutes and accuracy of 10\%, based on GFP and Lux reporter libraries. Focusing on the amino-acid biosynthesis systems of Escherichia coli, we identified a previously unknown temporal expression program and expression hierarchy that matches the enzyme order in unbranched pathways. We identified two design principles: the closer the enzyme is to the beginning of the pathway, the shorter the response time of the activation of its promoter and the higher its maximal promoter activity. Mathematical analysis suggests that this 'just-in-time' (ref. 5) transcription program is optimal under constraints of rapidly reaching a production goal with minimal total enzyme production. Our findings suggest that metabolic regulation networks are designed to generate precision promoter timing and activity programs that can be understood using the engineering principles of production pipelines.},

  Abstract                 = {Multi-component signal transduction pathways and gene regulatory circuits underpin integrated cellular responses to perturbations. A recurring set of network motifs serve as the basic building blocks of these molecular signalling networks. This review focuses on ultrasensitive response motifs (URMs) that amplify small percentage changes in the input signal into larger percentage changes in the output response. URMs generally possess a sigmoid input-output relationship that is steeper than the Michaelis-Menten type of response and is often approximated by the Hill function. Six types of URMs can be commonly found in intracellular molecular networks and each has a distinct kinetic mechanism for signal amplification. These URMs are: (i) positive cooperative binding, (ii) homo-multimerization, (iii) multistep signalling, (iv) molecular titration, (v) zero-order covalent modification cycle and (vi) positive feedback. Multiple URMs can be combined to generate highly switch-like responses. Serving as basic signal amplifiers, these URMs are essential for molecular circuits to produce complex nonlinear dynamics, including multistability, robust adaptation and oscillation. These dynamic properties are in turn responsible for higher-level cellular behaviours, such as cell fate determination, homeostasis and biological rhythm.},
