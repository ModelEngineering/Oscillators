abstract = {One of the most generally applicable algorithms for the derivation of steady-state rate equations for complex enzyme reaction mechanisms is that of King and Altman. Several modifications of this algorithm have been suggested; however, each requires the generation of numerous valid and invalid patterns and the subsequent elimination of those that are invalid. A method is presented, employing topological theory of linear graphs, for the systematic generation of only those patterns which are valid. This method is readily adaptable to use on a digital computer. An independent method for the calculation of the number of valid patterns is also presented. This calculation can be used to substantiate the accuracy of the patterns obtained. This calculation is also adaptable to computerization. Examples are included to demonstrate both the generation of patterns and the calculation of their number for specific enzyme mechanisms.}

Here we present a complementary approach to this problem: the design and construction of a synthetic network to implement a particular function. We used three transcriptional repressor systems that are not part of any natural biological clock to build an oscillating network, termed the repressilator, in Escherichia coli. The network periodically induces the synthesis of green fluorescent protein as a readout of its state in individual cells. The resulting oscillations, with typical periods of hours, are slower than the cell-division cycle, so the state of the oscillator has to be transmitted from generation to generation. This artificial clock displays noisy behaviour, possibly because of stochastic fluctuations of its components. Such 'rational network design may lead both to the engineering of new cellular behaviours and to an improved understanding of naturally occurring networks.},

	abstract = {Functional organization of signal transduction into protein phosphorylation cascades, such as the mitogen-activated protein kinase ({MAPK}) cascades, greatly enhances the sensitivity of cellular targets to external stimuli. The sensitivity increases multiplicatively with the number of cascade levels, so that a tiny change in a stimulus results in a large change in the response, the phenomenon referred to as ultrasensitivity. In a variety of cell types, the {MAPK} cascades are imbedded in long feedback loops, positive or negative, depending on whether the terminal kinase stimulates or inhibits the activation of the initial level. Here we demonstrate that a negative feedback loop combined with intrinsic ultrasensitivity of the {MAPK} cascade can bring about sustained oscillations in {MAPK} phosphorylation. Based on recent kinetic data on the {MAPK} cascades, we predict that the period of oscillations can range from minutes to hours. The phosphorylation level can vary between the base level and almost 100\% of the total protein. The oscillations of the phosphorylation cascades and slow protein diffusion in the cytoplasm can lead to intracellular waves of phospho-proteins.},

	abstract = {A minimal model for the mitotic oscillator is presented. The model, built on recent experimental advances, is based on the cascade of post-translational modification that modulates the activity of cdc2 kinase during the cell cycle. The model pertains to the situation encountered in early amphibian embryos, where the accumulation of cyclin suffices to trigger the onset of mitosis. In the first cycle of the bicyclic cascade model, cyclin promotes the activation of cdc2 kinase through reversible dephosphorylation, and in the second cycle, cdc2 kinase activates a cyclin protease by reversible phosphorylation. That cyclin activates cdc2 kinase while the kinase triggers the degradation of cyclin has suggested that oscillations may originate from such a negative feedback loop [Felix, M. A., Labbe, J. C., Doree, M., Hunt, T. \& Karsenti, E. (1990) Nature (London) 346, 379-382]. This conjecture is corroborated by the model, which indicates that sustained oscillations of the limit cycle type can arise in the cascade, provided that a threshold exists in the activation of cdc2 kinase by cyclin and in the activation of cyclin proteolysis by cdc2 kinase. The analysis shows how miototic oscillations may readily arise from time lags associated with these thresholds and from the delayed negative feedback provided by cdc2-induced cyclin degradation. A mechanism for the origin of the thresholds is proposed in terms of the phenomenon of zero-order ultrasensitivity previously described for biochemical systems regulated by covalent modification.},

	abstract = {Bacterial synthetic gene networks are constructed by manipulating the regulation of genes inside a cell, with the purpose of eliciting novel regulatory behaviors. The methods for manipulating genes and gene regulation in E. coli are well established, making it the preferred host for basic studies of synthetic networks. We focus our work on constructing two kinds of synthetic gene networks: toggle switches (bistable systems) and oscillators. Toggle switches are capable of exhibiting two stable steady states of gene expression ({OFF} and {ON}) without stable intermediate states; the steady state reached by the system depends on the previous history of the system. Biological oscillators exhibit regular cycles in gene expression around an unstable steady state. Studying these two kinds of synthetic networks helps advance our understanding of natural bistable systems and oscillators, such as the circadian oscillators controlling gene expression in many types of cells, and the genetic systems controlling the cell cycle and differentiation in metazoans. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, {LLC}.},

	abstract = {The structure of any differentiated tissue results from a well-defined sequence of events in which the spatial and temporal organization of the developing tissue mass are intimately related. It is as though every cell has access to, and can read, a clock and a map (Wolpert's positional information). A model developed in the present paper is one in which the map arises from wave-like propagation of activity from localized clocks or pacemakers. Individual cells are supposed temporally organized in the sense that biochemical events essential for the control of development recur periodically. This temporal organization of an individual cell is converted by functional coupling between cells into a spatial ordering of the temporal organization. More explicitly a periodic event is postulated which propagates outward from a pacemaker region, synchronizing the tissue and providing a time base for development. Intercellular signalling, entrainment of all cells in the tissue by the fastest cells in the pacemaker region, and a refractory period to guarantee unidirectional propagation are the essential features of the propagation; they permit the derivation of a wave equation and a set of boundary conditions. An underlying gradient of frequency of the event establishes the position of the pacemaker region and the sense of propagation. A second event which propagates more slowly than the first provides positional information in the form of a one-dimensional sequence of surfaces of constant phase difference between the two events. A third event is used to regulate the pattern of phase difference and thus establish size-independent structures. The longest trajectory orthogonal to the surfaces of constant phase difference beginning at the pacemaker region and terminating at the regulating region defines a developmental axis of definite polarity. The model is readily extended to more than one axis, i.e. multi-dimensional positional information. It has a high informational capacity and is readily applied to the discussion of particular developmental phenomena. To illustrate its utility, we discuss development and regeneration in Hydra, positional in the early amphibian embryo, and the retinal-neural tectal projection of the amphibian visual system. Specific experiments to test for the existence of the postulated periodic events and their consequences are suggested. Some preliminary experimental results on Hydra tending to confirm the model are reported. Possible detailed realizations of the model in terms of, biochemical control circuits within the cell, are conjectured and discussed to show that the formal features of the model can be realized by well-recognized biochemical processes. © 1969 Academic Press Inc.

	doi = {10.1098/rsif.2012.0028},
	abstract = {Feedback controls are central to cellular regulation. Negative-feedback mechanisms are well known to underline oscillatory dynamics. However, the presence of multiple negative-feedback mechanisms is common in oscillatory cellular systems, raising intriguing questions of how they cooperate to regulate oscillations. In this work, we studied the dynamical properties of a set of general biochemical motifs with dual, nested negative-feedback structures. We showed analytically and then confirmed numerically that, in these motifs, each negative-feedback loop exhibits distinctly different oscillation-controlling functions. The longer, outer feedback loop was found to promote oscillations, whereas the short, inner loop suppresses and can even eliminate oscillations. We found that the position of the inner loop within the coupled motifs affects its repression strength towards oscillatory dynamics. Bifurcation analysis indicated that emergence of oscillations may be a strict parametric requirement and thus evolutionarily tricky. Investigation of the quantitative features of oscillations (i.e. frequency, amplitude and mean value) revealed that coupling negative feedback provides robust tuning of the oscillation dynamics. Finally, we demonstrated that the mitogen-activated protein kinase ({MAPK}) cascades also display properties seen in the general nested feedback motifs. The findings and implications in this study provide novel understanding of biochemical negative-feedback regulation in a mixed wiring context. © 2012 The Royal Society.},

A computer (analogue) analysis is presented of differential equations representing control of enzyme synthesis by feedback repression, and non-linear oscillations are shown to occur. Phenomena such as synchronous locking and subharmonic resonance are shown to arise from the interaction of these oscillators, and the physiological significance of such non-linear behavior is discussed.

	abstract = {Circadian rhythmicity, the 24-hour cycle responsive to light and dark, is determined by periodic oscillations in gene transcription. This phenomenon has broad ramifications in physiologic function. Recent work has disclosed more cycles in gene transcription, and to the uncovering of these we apply a novel signal processing methodology known as the pencil method and compare it to conventional parametric, nonparametric, and statistical methods. Methods: In order to assess periodicity of gene expression over time, we analyzed a database derived from livers of mice entrained to a 12-hour light/12-hour dark cycle. We also analyzed artificially generated signals to identify differences between the pencil decomposition and other alternative methods. Results: The pencil decomposition revealed hitherto-unsuspected oscillations in gene transcription with 12-hour periodicity. The pencil method was robust in detecting the 24-hour circadian cycle that was known to exist, as well as confirming the existence of shorter-period oscillations. A key consequence of this approach is that orthogonality of the different oscillatory components can be demonstrated. thus indicating a biological independence of these oscillations, that has been subsequently confirmed empirically by knocking out the gene responsible for the 24-hour clock. Conclusion: System identification techniques can be applied to biological systems and can uncover important characteristics that may elude visual inspection of the data. Significance: The pencil method provides new insights on the essence of gene expression and discloses a wide variety of oscillations in addition to the well-studied circadian pattern. This insight opens the door to the study of novel mechanisms by which oscillatory gene expression signals exert their regulatory effect on cells to influence human diseases.},

At this scale the dynamics of molecular systems becomes stochastic, which introduces several engineering challenges and opportunities. Here we study a programmable transcriptional oscillator system that is compartmentalized into microemulsion droplets with volumes between 33 fl and 16 pl. Simultaneous measurement of large populations of droplets reveals major variations in the amplitude, frequency and damping of the oscillations. Variability increases for smaller droplets and depends on the operating point of the oscillator. Rather than reflecting the stochastic kinetics of the chemical reaction network itself, the variability can be attributed to the statistical variation of reactant concentrations created during their partitioning into droplets. We anticipate that robustness to partitioning variability will be a critical challenge for engineering cell-scale systems, and that highly parallel time-series acquisition from microemulsion droplets will become a key tool for characterization of stochastic circuit function. © 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited.},

This tunability makes the latter design suitable for biological rhythms like heartbeats and cell cycles that need to provide a constant output over a range of frequencies.

Elucidating their fundamental mechanisms is of great significance to diseases, and yet challenging, due to the complexity and diversity of these oscillators. Results: Approaches in quantitative systems biology and synthetic biology have been most effective by simplifying the systems to contain only the most essential regulators. Here, we will review major progress that has been made in understanding biological oscillators using these approaches. The quantitative systems biology approach allows for identification of the essential components of an oscillator in an endogenous system. The synthetic biology approach makes use of the knowledge to design the simplest, de novo oscillators in both live cells and cell-free systems. These synthetic oscillators are tractable to further detailed analysis and manipulations.

Using a photo-sensitive degron and red fluorescent proteins as reporters, we show that under constitutive transcriptional induction, repeated triangular protein level oscillations as fast as 5-10 min-scale can be generated by modulating the protein degradation rate. Consistent with oscillations generated though transcriptional control, we observed a continuous decrease in the magnitude of oscillations as the input modulation frequency increased, indicating low-pass filtering of input perturbation. By using two red fluorescent proteins with distinct maturation times, we show that the oscillations in protein level is largely unaffected by delays originating from functional protein formation.

Although there are methods to create more stable oscillators, such as repressilators, independently controlling the oscillation of reporter genes in terms of their amplitude and period is only on theoretical level. Here, we introduce a new oscillator circuit that can be independently controlled by two inducers in
              Escherichia coli
              . Some control components, including σ{ECF}11 and {NahR}, were added to the circuit. By systematically tuning the concentration of the inducers, salicylate and {IPTG}, the amplitude and period can be modulated independently. Furthermore, we constructed a quantitative model to forecast the regulation results. Under the guidance of the model, the expected oscillation can be regulated by choosing the proper concentration combinations of inducers. In summary, our work achieved independent control of the oscillator circuit, which allows the oscillator to be modularized and used in more complex circuit designs.},

	abstract = {Analysis of the system design principles of signaling systems requires model systems where all components and regulatory interactions are known. Components of the Lac and Ntr systems were used to construct genetic circuits that display toggle switch or oscillatory behavior. Both devices contain an “activator module” consisting of a modified {glnA} promoter with lac operators, driving the expression of the activator, {NRI}. Since {NRI} activates the {glnA} promoter, this creates an autoactivated circuit repressible by {LacI}. The oscillator contains a “repressor module” consisting of the {NRI}-activated {glnK} promoter driving {LacI} expression. This circuitry produced synchronous damped oscillations in turbidostat cultures, with periods much longer than the cell cycle. For the toggle switch, {LacI} was provided constitutively; the level of active repressor was controlled by using a {lacY} mutant and varying the concentration of {IPTG}. This circuitry provided nearly discontinuous expression of activator.},

	abstract = {Background: Synthetic microbial consortia are conglomerations of genetically engineered microbes programmed to cooperatively bring about population-level phenotypes. By coordinating their activity, the constituent strains can display emergent behaviors that are difﬁcult to engineer into isogenic populations. To do so, strains are engineered to communicate with one another through intercellular signaling pathways that depend on cell density.
Methods: Here, we used computational modeling to examine how the behavior of synthetic microbial consortia results from the interplay between population dynamics governed by cell growth and internal transcriptional dynamics governed by cell-cell signaling. Speciﬁcally, we examined a synthetic microbial consortium in which two strains each produce signals that down-regulate transcription in the other. Within a single strain this regulatory topology is called a “co-repressive toggle switch” and can lead to bistability.
Results: We found that in co-repressive synthetic microbial consortia the existence and stability of different states depend on population-level dynamics. As the two strains passively compete for space within the colony, their relative fractions ﬂuctuate and thus alter the strengths of intercellular signals. These ﬂuctuations drive the consortium to alternative equilibria. Additionally, if the growth rates of the strains depend on their transcriptional states, an additional feedback loop is created that can generate oscillations.
Conclusions: Our ﬁndings demonstrate that the dynamics of microbial consortia cannot be predicted from their regulatory topologies alone, but are also determined by interactions between the strains. Therefore, when designing synthetic microbial consortia that use intercellular signaling, one must account for growth variations caused by the production of protein.},

	abstract = {Generating robust, predictable perturbations in cellular protein levels will advance our understanding of protein function and enable the control of physiological outcomes in biotechnology applications. Timed periodic changes in protein levels play a critical role in the cell division cycle, cellular stress response, and development. Here we report the generation of robust protein level oscillations by controlling the protein degradation rate in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Using a photo-sensitive degron and red fluorescent proteins as reporters, we show that under constitutive transcriptional induction, repeated triangular protein level oscillations as fast as 5-10 min-scale can be generated by modulating the protein degradation rate. Consistent with oscillations generated though transcriptional control, we observed a continuous decrease in the magnitude of oscillations as the input modulation frequency increased, indicating low-pass filtering of input perturbation. By using two red fluorescent proteins with distinct maturation times, we show that the oscillations in protein level is largely unaffected by delays originating from functional protein formation. Our study demonstrates the potential for repeated control of protein levels by controlling the protein degradation rate without altering the transcription rate.},

	abstract = {New tools and software in systems biology require testing and validation on reaction networks with desired characteristics such as number of reactions or oscillating behaviors. Often, there is only a modest number of published models that are suitable, so researchers must generate reaction networks with the desired characteristics, a process that can be computationally expensive. To reduce these computational costs, we developed a data base of synthetic reaction networks to facilitate reuse. The current database contains thousands of networks generated using directed evolution. The network are of two types: (1) those with oscillations in species concentrations and (2) those for which no oscillation was found using directed evolution. To facilitate access to networks of interest, the database is queryable by the number of species and reactants, the presence or absence of autocatalytic and degradation reactions, and the network behavior. Our analysis of the data revealed some interesting insights, such as the population of oscillating networks possess more autocatalytic reactions compared to random control networks. In the future, this database will be expanded to include other network behaviors.},

Unlike the synchronization of segmentation clocks, oscillations in neural progenitors are asynchronous between cells. It is known that Notch signaling, in which Notch in a cell can be activated by Dll1 in neighboring cells (trans-activation) and can also be inhibited by Dll1 within the same cell (cis-inhibition), is important for neural fate decisions. There have been extensive studies of trans-activation, but the operating mechanisms and potential implications of cis-inhibition are less clear and need to be further investigated.},
